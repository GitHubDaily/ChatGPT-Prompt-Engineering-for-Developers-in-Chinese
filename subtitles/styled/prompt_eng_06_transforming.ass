Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.00,0:00:09.84,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Large language models are very good at transforming its input to a different format
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.84,0:00:14.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,such as inputting a piece of text in one language and transforming it or
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.10,0:00:19.30,灰英字,,0,0,0,,translating it to a different language or helping with spelling and grammar corrections
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.30,0:00:21.78,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So taking as input a piece of text that may not be
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.78,0:00:25.02,灰英字,,0,0,0,,fully grammatical and helping you to fix that up a bit
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.02,0:00:28.38,灰英字,,0,0,0,,or even transforming formats such as inputting
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.38,0:00:31.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,HTML and outputting JSON
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.10,0:00:35.14,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So there's a bunch of applications that I used to write somewhat painfully with
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.14,0:00:38.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,a bunch of regular expressions that would definitely be much more
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.10,0:00:41.80,灰英字,,0,0,0,,simply implemented now with a large language model and a few prompts
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.80,0:00:46.50,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I use ChatGPT to proofread pretty much everything I write these days
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.50,0:00:50.34,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So I'm excited to show you some more examples in the notebook now
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.34,0:00:55.90,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So first, we'll import openai and also
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.90,0:01:01.18,灰英字,,0,0,0,,use the same get_completion helper function that we've been using throughout the videos
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.18,0:01:04.54,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The first thing we'll do is a translation task
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.54,0:01:09.94,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So large language models are trained on a lot of text from many sources
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.94,0:01:11.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,a lot of which is the Internet
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.10,0:01:13.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and this is of course in many different languages
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.60,0:01:17.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So this imbues the model with the ability to do translation
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.58,0:01:22.38,灰英字,,0,0,0,,These models know hundreds of languages to varying degrees of proficiency
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.38,0:01:26.54,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So we'll go through some examples of how to use this capability
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.54,0:01:29.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's start off with something simple
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.58,0:01:31.54,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So in this first example
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.54,0:01:35.70,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the prompt is translate the following English text to Spanish
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.70,0:01:38.26,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Hi, I would like to order a blender
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.26,0:01:40.62,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The response is, Hola
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.62,0:01:45.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,me gustaría ordenar una licuadora
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.58,0:01:48.66,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I'm very sorry to all of you Spanish speakers
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.66,0:01:53.62,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I never learned Spanish unfortunately, as you can definitely tell
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.50,0:01:57.22,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Let's try another example
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.22,0:02:00.46,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So in this example
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.46,0:02:04.22,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the prompt is, tell me what language this is
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.22,0:02:06.98,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Then this is in French
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.98,0:02:09.70,灰英字,,0,0,0,,combien coûte le lampadaire?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.70,0:02:12.02,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's run this
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.82,0:02:17.34,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The model has identified that this is French
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.34,0:02:22.22,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The model can also do multiple translations at once
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.22,0:02:23.90,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So in this example
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.90,0:02:27.74,灰英字,,0,0,0,,let's say translate the following text to French and Spanish
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.74,0:02:29.94,灰英字,,0,0,0,,You know what, let's add another
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.94,0:02:34.06,灰英字,,0,0,0,,an English pirate
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.38,0:02:38.50,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The text is, I want to order a basketball
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.46,0:02:43.18,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So here we have French
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.18,0:02:47.30,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Spanish, and English pirate
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.30,0:02:49.30,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So in some languages
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.30,0:02:51.34,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the translation can change depending on
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.34,0:02:53.66,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the speaker's relationship to the listener
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.66,0:02:56.86,灰英字,,0,0,0,,You can also explain this to the language model
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.86,0:03:00.38,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and so it will be able to translate accordingly
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.38,0:03:02.54,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So in this example
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.54,0:03:07.22,灰英字,,0,0,0,,we say translate the following text to Spanish in both the formal and informal forms
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.22,0:03:09.06,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Would you like to order a pillow?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.06,0:03:11.26,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Also notice here, we're using
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.26,0:03:14.30,灰英字,,0,0,0,,a different delimiter than these backticks
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.30,0:03:18.26,灰英字,,0,0,0,,It doesn't really matter as long as it's a clear separation
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.26,0:03:22.70,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So here we have the formal and informal
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.70,0:03:25.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So formal is when you're speaking to someone who's
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.58,0:03:28.98,灰英字,,0,0,0,,maybe senior to you or you're in a professional situation
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.98,0:03:30.34,灰英字,,0,0,0,,That's when you use a formal tone
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.34,0:03:34.54,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then informal is when you're speaking to maybe a group of friends
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.54,0:03:36.30,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I don't actually speak Spanish
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.30,0:03:39.50,灰英字,,0,0,0,,but my dad does and he says that this is correct
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.50,0:03:42.02,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So for the next example
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.02,0:03:47.90,灰英字,,0,0,0,,we're going to pretend that we're in charge of a multinational e-commerce company
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.90,0:03:51.78,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and so the user messages are going to be in all different languages
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.78,0:03:57.34,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and so users are going to be telling us about the IT issues in wide variety of languages
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.34,0:04:00.30,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So we need a universal translator
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.30,0:04:06.98,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So first, we'll just paste in a list of user messages in a variety of different languages
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.98,0:04:15.66,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Now, we will loop through each of these user messages
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.66,0:04:19.90,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So for issue in user messages
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.98,0:04:25.22,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then I'm going to copy over the slightly longer code block
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.22,0:04:28.74,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So the first thing we'll do is ask the model
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.74,0:04:32.42,灰英字,,0,0,0,,to tell us what language the issue is in
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.42,0:04:34.26,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So here's the prompt
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.26,0:04:40.38,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Then we'll print out the original messages language and the issue
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.38,0:04:45.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then we'll ask the model to translate it into English and Korean
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.10,0:04:51.86,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's run this. So the original message in French
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.74,0:04:58.30,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So we have a variety of languages
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.30,0:05:02.94,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then the model translates them into English and then Korean
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.94,0:05:06.18,灰英字,,0,0,0,,You can see here, so the model says
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.18,0:05:07.70,灰英字,,0,0,0,,this is French
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.70,0:05:13.38,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So that's because the response from this prompt is going to be, this is French
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.38,0:05:16.18,灰英字,,0,0,0,,You could try editing this prompt to say something like
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.18,0:05:17.54,灰英字,,0,0,0,,tell me what language this is
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.54,0:05:22.22,灰英字,,0,0,0,,respond with only one word or don't use a sentence
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.22,0:05:25.34,灰英字,,0,0,0,,that kind of thing if you wanted this to just be one word
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.34,0:05:28.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,or you could ask for it in a JSON format or something like that
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.58,0:05:33.42,灰英字,,0,0,0,,which would probably encourage it to not use a whole sentence
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.42,0:05:38.62,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So amazing, you've just built a universal translator
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.62,0:05:45.18,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and also feel free to pause the video and add any other languages you want to try here
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.18,0:05:47.34,灰英字,,0,0,0,,maybe languages you speak yourself
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.34,0:05:49.86,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and see how the model does
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.86,0:05:55.06,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So the next thing we're going to dive into is tone transformation
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.06,0:05:58.30,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Writing can vary based on an intended audience
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.30,0:06:03.14,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the way that I would write an e-mail to a colleague or a professor
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.14,0:06:06.82,灰英字,,0,0,0,,is obviously going to be quite different to the way I text my younger brother
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.82,0:06:10.98,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So ChatGPT can actually also help produce different tones
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.98,0:06:14.26,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's look at some examples
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.26,0:06:16.62,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So in this first example
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.62,0:06:20.78,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the prompt is, translate the following from slang to a business letter
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.78,0:06:22.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Dude, this is Joe
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.10,0:06:25.18,灰英字,,0,0,0,,check out the spec on the standing lamp
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.18,0:06:29.46,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's execute this
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.46,0:06:35.50,灰英字,,0,0,0,,As you can see, we have a much more formal business letter
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.50,0:06:39.66,灰英字,,0,0,0,,with a proposal for a standing lamp specification
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.66,0:06:44.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The next thing that we're going to do is to convert between different formats
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.58,0:06:50.26,灰英字,,0,0,0,,ChatGPT is very good at translating between different formats such as JSON to HTML
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.26,0:06:54.30,灰英字,,0,0,0,,XML, all kinds of things, markdown
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.30,0:06:58.66,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So in the prompt, we'll describe both the input and the output formats
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.66,0:07:01.90,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So here is an example
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.90,0:07:05.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So we have this JSON that
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.10,0:07:10.34,灰英字,,0,0,0,,contains a list of restaurant employees with their name and e-mail
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.34,0:07:12.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Then in the prompt
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.58,0:07:17.94,灰英字,,0,0,0,,we're going to ask the model to translate this from JSON to HTML
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.94,0:07:22.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So the prompt is, translate the following Python dictionary from JSON to
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.10,0:07:26.26,灰英字,,0,0,0,,HTML with column headers and titles
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.22,0:07:35.38,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Then we'll get the response from the model and print it
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.38,0:07:44.14,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So here we have some HTML displaying all of the employee names and e-mails
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.14,0:07:49.22,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So now let's see if we can actually view this HTML
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.22,0:07:54.46,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So we're going to use this display function from this Python library
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.46,0:07:58.86,灰英字,,0,0,0,,display HTML response
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.10,0:08:06.34,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Here you can see that this is a properly formatted HTML table
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.42,0:08:13.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The next transformation task we're going to do is spell check and grammar checking
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.10,0:08:16.74,灰英字,,0,0,0,,This is a really popular use for ChatGPT
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.74,0:08:18.78,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I highly recommend doing this
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.78,0:08:20.06,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I do this all the time
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.06,0:08:23.38,灰英字,,0,0,0,,It's especially useful when you're working in a non-native language
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.38,0:08:28.14,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So here are some examples of some common grammar and spelling problems
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.14,0:08:31.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and how the language model can help address these
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.58,0:08:40.50,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to paste in a list of sentences that have some grammatical or spelling errors
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.50,0:08:46.42,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Then we're going to loop through each of these sentences
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.14,0:08:50.74,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.62,0:08:56.62,灰英字,,0,0,0,,ask the model to proofread these.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.62,0:09:02.50,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Proofread and correct. And then we'll use some delimiters.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.50,0:09:15.50,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And then we will get the response and print it as usual.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.26,0:09:41.42,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so the model is able to correct all of these grammatical errors
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.42,0:09:44.18,灰英字,,0,0,0,,We could use some of the techniques that we've discussed before
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.18,0:09:50.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So to improve the prompt, we could say proofread and correct the following text
Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.10,0:09:54.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And rewrite
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.58,0:09:55.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Oh
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.58,0:10:05.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And rewrite the whole
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.58,0:10:10.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And rewrite it
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.58,0:10:16.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Corrected version
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.58,0:10:25.70,灰英字,,0,0,0,,If you don't find any errors, just say no errors found
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.70,0:10:29.70,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Let's try this
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.70,0:10:37.70,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So this way we were able to, oh, they're still using quotes here
Dialogue: 0,0:10:37.70,0:10:42.94,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But you can imagine you'd be able to find a way with a little bit of
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.94,0:10:45.78,灰英字,,0,0,0,,iterative prompt development to
Dialogue: 0,0:10:45.78,0:10:49.26,灰英字,,0,0,0,,kind of find a prompt that works more reliably every single time
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.26,0:10:51.70,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so now we'll do another example
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.70,0:10:56.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,It's always useful to check your text before you post it in a public forum
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.04,0:10:59.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so we'll go through an example of checking a review
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.10,0:11:01.98,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so here is a review about a stuffed panda
Dialogue: 0,0:11:01.98,0:11:06.74,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so we're going to ask the model to proofread and correct the review
Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.74,0:11:11.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Great. So we have this corrected version
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.10,0:11:14.86,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And one cool thing we can do is find
Dialogue: 0,0:11:14.86,0:11:19.18,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the kind of differences between our original review and the model's output
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.18,0:11:24.38,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So we're going to use this red lines Python package to do this
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.38,0:11:26.80,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And we're going to get the diff between
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.80,0:11:32.46,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the original text of our review and the model output
Dialogue: 0,0:11:32.46,0:11:36.74,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then display this
Dialogue: 0,0:11:36.74,0:11:40.34,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so here you can see the diff between the original review
Dialogue: 0,0:11:40.34,0:11:44.94,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and the model output and the kind of things that have been corrected
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.94,0:11:49.38,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So the prompt that we use was proofread and correct this review
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.38,0:11:52.82,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But you can also make kind of more dramatic changes
Dialogue: 0,0:11:52.82,0:11:55.70,灰英字,,0,0,0,,kind of changes to tone and that kind of thing
Dialogue: 0,0:11:55.70,0:12:00.34,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's try one more thing
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.34,0:12:04.50,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So in this prompt, we're going to ask the model to proofread and correct
Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.50,0:12:08.70,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the same review, but also make it more compelling and ensure that it
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.70,0:12:11.86,灰英字,,0,0,0,,follows APA style and targets an advanced reader
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.86,0:12:14.86,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And we're also going to ask for the output in markdown format
Dialogue: 0,0:12:14.86,0:12:18.78,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so we're using the same text from the original review up here
Dialogue: 0,0:12:18.78,0:12:23.26,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's execute this
Dialogue: 0,0:12:23.26,0:12:30.38,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And here we have a expanded APA style review of the soft Panda
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.38,0:12:32.30,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So this is it for the transforming video
Dialogue: 0,0:12:32.30,0:12:35.70,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Next up, we have expanding where we'll take a shorter prompt
Dialogue: 0,0:12:35.70,0:12:54.18,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and kind of generate a longer, more freeform response from a language model
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.00,0:00:09.84,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,大语言模型非常善于将其输入转换为不同的格式
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.84,0:00:14.10,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,例如，输入一种语言的文本并将其转换或
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.10,0:00:19.30,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,把它翻译成不同的语言，或者帮助进行拼写和语法的修正
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.30,0:00:21.78,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，将一段可能不符合标准的语法文本作为输入
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.78,0:00:25.02,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,并让它帮助你纠正拼写和语法
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.02,0:00:28.38,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,或甚至转换格式，如
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.38,0:00:31.10,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,输入HTML和输出JSON
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.10,0:00:35.14,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以，我以前写的一些应用程序有点痛苦，用的是
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.14,0:00:38.10,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,一堆正则表达式的应用
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.10,0:00:41.80,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,现在用一个大语言模型和一些提示语就可以更简单地实现
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.80,0:00:46.50,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,是的，我现在用ChatGPT来校对我写的几乎所有东西
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.50,0:00:50.34,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我很高兴现在向你展示Notebook中的一些更多的例子
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.34,0:00:55.90,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以，首先，我们将导入openai，同时
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.90,0:01:01.18,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,使用我们在整个视频中一直使用的get_completion辅助函数
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.18,0:01:04.54,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们要做的第一件事是一个翻译任务
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.54,0:01:09.94,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，大语言模型是在许多来源的大量文本上训练出来的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.94,0:01:11.10,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,其中有很多是互联网
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.10,0:01:13.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这当然是用许多不同的语言
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.60,0:01:17.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，这使模型具有翻译能力
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.58,0:01:22.38,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这些模型知道数百种语言的不同程度的熟练程度
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.38,0:01:26.54,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我们将通过一些例子来说明如何使用这种能力
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.54,0:01:29.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以，让我们从简单的东西开始
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.58,0:01:31.54,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以在这第一个例子中
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.54,0:01:35.70,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,提示是将以下英文文本翻译成西班牙语
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.70,0:01:38.26,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你好，我想订购一台搅拌机
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.26,0:01:40.62,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,响应是：Hola
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.62,0:01:45.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,me gustaría ordenar una licuadora.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.58,0:01:48.66,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我对所有讲西班牙语的人感到非常抱歉
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.66,0:01:53.62,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我从来没有学过西班牙语，很不幸，你肯定能看出来
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.50,0:01:57.22,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让我们尝试另一个例子
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.22,0:02:00.46,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以在这个例子中
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.46,0:02:04.22,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,提示是，告诉我这是什么语言
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.22,0:02:06.98,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,那么这是用法语说的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.98,0:02:09.70,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,combien coûte le lampadaire?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.70,0:02:12.02,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我们来运行这个
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.82,0:02:17.34,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,该模型已经识别出这是法语
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.34,0:02:22.22,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,该模型还可以一次做多个翻译
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.22,0:02:23.90,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以在这个例子中
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.90,0:02:27.74,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让我们说把下面的文字翻译成法语和西班牙语
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.74,0:02:29.94,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你知道吗，让我们再加一个
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.94,0:02:34.06,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,英国海盗
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.38,0:02:38.50,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这段文字是，我想订购一个篮球
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.46,0:02:43.18,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这里我们有法语
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.18,0:02:47.30,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,西班牙文，和英国海盗
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.30,0:02:49.30,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以在某些语言中
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.30,0:02:51.34,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,翻译可以改变，取决于
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.34,0:02:53.66,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,说话人与听话人的关系
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.66,0:02:56.86,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你也可以向语言模型解释这一点
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.86,0:03:00.38,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这样它就能进行相应的翻译
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.38,0:03:02.54,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以在这个例子中
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.54,0:03:07.22,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们说把下面的文字以正式和非正式的形式翻译成西班牙语
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.22,0:03:09.06,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你想订购一个枕头吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.06,0:03:11.26,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,还注意到，我们在这里使用了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.26,0:03:14.30,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,不同的分隔符，而不是这些双引号
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.30,0:03:18.26,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,其实这并不重要，只要它是一个清晰的分隔
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.26,0:03:22.70,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这里我们有正式和非正式
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.70,0:03:25.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，正式的是当你和某人说话时，他是
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.58,0:03:28.98,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,也许比你高级的人，或者你是在一个专业的情况下
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.98,0:03:30.34,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这时你要使用正式语气
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.34,0:03:34.54,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后非正式的是当你和一群朋友说话时
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.54,0:03:36.30,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我实际上不会说西班牙语
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.30,0:03:39.50,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但我父亲会，他说这是正确的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.50,0:03:42.02,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，对于
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.02,0:03:47.90,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们要假装自己是一家跨国电子商务公司的负责人
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.90,0:03:51.78,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,用户的信息将使用所有不同的语言
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.78,0:03:57.34,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，用户将用各种不同的语言告诉我们关于IT的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.34,0:04:00.30,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我们需要一个通用的翻译器
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.30,0:04:06.98,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，首先，我们将粘贴一个各种不同语言的用户信息的列表
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.98,0:04:15.66,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,现在，我们将循环浏览这些用户信息中的每一条
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.66,0:04:19.90,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，对于用户信息中的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.98,0:04:25.22,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后我将复制稍长的代码块
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.22,0:04:28.74,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我们要做的第一件事是要求模型
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.74,0:04:32.42,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,告诉我们这个问题是什么语言的
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.42,0:04:34.26,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这里是提示
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.26,0:04:40.38,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后，我们将打印出原始信息的语言和问题
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.38,0:04:45.10,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后我们将要求模型将其翻译成英语和韩语
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.10,0:04:51.86,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以让我们运行这个。所以，原始信息是法语
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.74,0:04:58.30,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我们有各种语言
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.30,0:05:02.94,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后模型将它们翻译成英语和韩语
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.94,0:05:06.18,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你可以看到这里，所以模型说
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.18,0:05:07.70,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这是法语
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.70,0:05:13.38,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这是因为这个提示的反应将是，这是法语
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.38,0:05:16.18,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你可以尝试将这个提示编辑成这样的内容
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.18,0:05:17.54,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,告诉我这是什么语言
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.54,0:05:22.22,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,只用一个词来回答或不用句子
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.22,0:05:25.34,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,如果你希望这只是一个词的话
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.34,0:05:28.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,或者你可以要求它以JSON格式或类似的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.58,0:05:33.42,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这可能会鼓励它不要使用整个句子
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.42,0:05:38.62,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，令人惊讶的是，你刚刚建立了一个通用翻译器
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.62,0:05:45.18,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,也可以随时暂停视频，在这里添加任何你想尝试的其他语言
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.18,0:05:47.34,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,也许是你自己说的语言
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.34,0:05:49.86,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,看看这个模型是怎么做的
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.86,0:05:55.06,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，我们接下来要深入研究的是语气转换
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.06,0:05:58.30,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,写作可以根据目标受众而有所不同
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.30,0:06:03.14,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我给同事或教授写电子邮件的方式
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.14,0:06:06.82,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,显然会与我给我弟弟发短信的方式完全不同
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.82,0:06:10.98,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以ChatGPT实际上也可以帮助产生不同的语气
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.98,0:06:14.26,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，让我们看一些例子
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.26,0:06:16.62,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在这第一个例子中
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.62,0:06:20.78,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,提示是，将以下内容从俚语翻译成商务信函
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.78,0:06:22.10,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,老兄，这是乔
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.10,0:06:25.18,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,检查一下这盏落地灯的规格
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.18,0:06:29.46,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，让我们来执行这个
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.46,0:06:35.50,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,正如你所看到的，我们有一封更正式的商业信函
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.50,0:06:39.66,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,有一个关于落地灯规格的建议
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.66,0:06:44.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们要做的下一件事是在不同的格式之间进行转换
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.58,0:06:50.26,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,ChatGPT非常善于在不同的格式之间进行转换，如JSON到HTML
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.26,0:06:54.30,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,XML，各种各样的东西，markdown
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.30,0:06:58.66,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以在提示中，我们将描述输入和输出的格式
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.66,0:07:01.90,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这里有一个例子
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.90,0:07:05.10,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我们有这样一个JSON
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.10,0:07:10.34,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,它包含一个餐厅员工的名单，包括他们的名字和电子邮件
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.34,0:07:12.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后在提示中
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.58,0:07:17.94,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们将要求模型将其从JSON翻译成HTML
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.94,0:07:22.10,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以提示是，把下面的Python字典从JSON翻译成
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.10,0:07:26.26,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,HTML，包括列头和标题
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.22,0:07:35.38,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后我们将从模型中得到响应并打印出来
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.38,0:07:44.14,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这里我们有一些HTML显示所有的雇员姓名和电子邮件
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.14,0:07:49.22,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,那么现在让我们来看看我们是否可以作为
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.22,0:07:54.46,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我们要使用这个Python库中的这个显示函数
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.46,0:07:58.86,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,显示 HTML 响应
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.10,0:08:06.34,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在这里你可以看到这是一个正确格式化的HTML表格
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.42,0:08:13.10,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们要做的下一个转换任务是拼写检查和语法检查
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.10,0:08:16.74,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这是ChatGPT的一个非常流行的用途
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.74,0:08:18.78,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我强烈建议这样做
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.78,0:08:20.06,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我一直在做这个
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.06,0:08:23.38,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,当你用非母语工作时，它尤其有用
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.38,0:08:28.14,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，这里有一些常见的语法和拼写问题的例子
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.14,0:08:31.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,以及语言模型如何帮助解决这些问题
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.58,0:08:40.50,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我将粘贴一个有一些语法或拼写错误的句子列表
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.50,0:08:46.42,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后，我们将循环浏览每一个句子
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.14,0:08:50.74,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.62,0:08:56.62,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让模型进行校对
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.62,0:09:02.50,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,校对并进行修正。然后我们将使用一些分隔符
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.50,0:09:15.50,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后我们将获取响应并将其打印出来，就像往常一样
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.26,0:09:41.42,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,就这样，这个模型能够纠正所有这些语法错误
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.42,0:09:44.18,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们可以使用我们之前讨论过的一些技术
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.18,0:09:50.10,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，为了改进提示，我们可以说校对和纠正以下文字
Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.10,0:09:54.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,并重写
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.58,0:09:55.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,哦
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.58,0:10:05.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,并重写整个
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.58,0:10:10.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,并重写
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.58,0:10:16.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,改正后的版本
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.58,0:10:25.70,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,如果你没有发现任何错误，就说没有发现错误
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.70,0:10:29.70,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让我们来试试这个
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.70,0:10:37.70,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，这种方式我们能够，哦，他们在这里仍然使用引号
