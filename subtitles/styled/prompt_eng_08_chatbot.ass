Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.00,0:00:08.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,One of the exciting things about a large language model is you could use it to
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.60,0:00:12.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,build a custom chatbot with only a modest amount of effort
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.68,0:00:17.66,灰英字,,0,0,0,,ChatGPT, the web interface is a way for you to have a conversational interface
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.66,0:00:20.50,灰英字,,0,0,0,,a conversation via a large language model
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.50,0:00:23.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But one of the cool things is you can also use
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.12,0:00:25.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,a large language model to build your custom chatbot
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.68,0:00:28.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,to maybe play the role of an AI customer service agent or
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.92,0:00:31.48,灰英字,,0,0,0,,an AI order taker for restaurants
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.48,0:00:34.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And in this video, you learn how to do that for yourself
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.40,0:00:37.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I'm going to describe the components of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.08,0:00:39.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the OpenAI chat completions format in more detail
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.96,0:00:42.54,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then you're going to build a chatbot yourself
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.54,0:00:44.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's get into it
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.40,0:00:49.00,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So first, we'll set up the OpenAI Python package as usual
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.00,0:00:53.38,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So chat models like ChatGPT are actually trained to take a series of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.38,0:00:57.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,messages as input and return a model generated message as output
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.64,0:00:59.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so although the chat format is designed to
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.96,0:01:02.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,make multi-turn conversations like this easy
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.32,0:01:06.00,灰英字,,0,0,0,,we've kind of seen through the previous videos that it's also just as
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.00,0:01:09.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,useful for single-turn tasks without any conversation
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.56,0:01:14.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so next, we're going to kind of define two helper functions
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.20,0:01:17.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So this is the one that we've been using throughout all the videos
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.08,0:01:20.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and it's the get_completion function
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.36,0:01:22.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But if you kind of look at it
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.08,0:01:25.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,we give a prompt, but then kind of inside the function
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.04,0:01:29.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,what we're actually doing is putting this prompt into what looks
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.32,0:01:32.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,what looks like some kind of user message
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.16,0:01:37.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And this is because the ChatGPT model is a chat model
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.20,0:01:40.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,which means it's trained to take a series of messages as input
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.20,0:01:44.00,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then return model generated messages output
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.00,0:01:45.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So the user message is kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.88,0:01:49.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the input and then the assistant message is the output
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.32,0:01:51.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So in this video
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.32,0:01:53.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,we're going to actually use a different helper function
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.76,0:01:55.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And instead of kind of putting
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.64,0:01:58.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,a single prompt as input and getting a single completion
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.40,0:02:01.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,we're going to pass in a list of messages
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.68,0:02:05.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And these messages can be kind of from a variety of different roles
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.40,0:02:07.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So I'll describe those
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.16,0:02:10.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So here's an example of a list of messages
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.04,0:02:12.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so the first message is
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.04,0:02:15.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,a system message which kind of gives an overall instruction
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.20,0:02:16.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And then after this message
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.36,0:02:20.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,we have kind of turns between the user and the assistant
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.04,0:02:21.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And this is kind of continue to go on
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.92,0:02:24.80,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And if you've ever used ChatGPT, the web interface
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.80,0:02:27.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,then your messages are the user messages
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.68,0:02:30.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then ChatGPT's messages are the assistant messages
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.88,0:02:33.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So the system message helps to kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.44,0:02:35.80,灰英字,,0,0,0,,set the behavior and persona of the assistant
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.80,0:02:38.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and it acts as kind of a high-level instruction for the conversation
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.92,0:02:40.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So you can kind of think of it as whispering in
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.64,0:02:42.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the assistant's ear and kind of guiding
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.44,0:02:46.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,its responses without the user being aware of the system message
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.32,0:02:47.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So as the user
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.96,0:02:49.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,if you've ever used ChatGPT
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.40,0:02:52.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,you probably don't know what's in ChatGPT's system message
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.64,0:02:55.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The benefit of the system message is that it provides you
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.36,0:02:57.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the developer, with a way to kind of frame
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.24,0:02:59.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the conversation without making
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.12,0:03:01.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the request itself part of the conversation
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.32,0:03:04.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So you can kind of guide the assistant and kind of whisper in
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.88,0:03:09.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,its ear and guide its responses without making the user aware
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.28,0:03:15.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So now let's try to use these messages in a conversation
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.08,0:03:19.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So we'll use our new helper function to get
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.16,0:03:21.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the completion from the messages
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.60,0:03:27.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and we're also using a higher temperature
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.20,0:03:29.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So the system message says
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.40,0:03:31.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,you are an assistant that speaks like Shakespeare
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.44,0:03:33.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So this is us kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.16,0:03:35.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,describing to the assistant how it should behave
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.96,0:03:38.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then the first user message is, tell me a joke
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.68,0:03:41.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The next is, why did the chicken cross the road?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.64,0:03:45.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Then the final user message is, I don't know
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.52,0:03:49.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So if we run this
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.60,0:03:55.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the response is to get to the other side. Let's try again
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.72,0:03:57.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,To get to the other side
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.92,0:03:59.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,fair sir or madam
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.24,0:04:02.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,it is an old and classic that never fails
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.04,0:04:05.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So that's our Shakespearean response
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.64,0:04:08.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Let's actually try one more thing because I want to make
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.96,0:04:11.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,it even clearer that this is the assistant message
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.52,0:04:19.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So here let's just go and print the entire message response
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.88,0:04:36.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So just to make this even clearer
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.24,0:04:41.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,this response is an assistant message
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.16,0:04:45.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So the role is assistant and then the content is the message itself
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.68,0:04:48.00,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So that's what's happening in this helper function
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.00,0:04:51.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,We're just passing out the content of the message
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.96,0:05:07.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So now let's do another example
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.96,0:05:09.84,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So here our messages are
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.84,0:05:13.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the system message is you're a friendly chatbot
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.16,0:05:14.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and the first user message is
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.56,0:05:16.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,hi, my name is Isa
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.12,0:05:20.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,We want to get the first user message
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.64,0:05:22.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's execute this
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.08,0:05:24.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the first assistant message
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.64,0:05:26.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So the first message is
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.88,0:05:28.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,hello Isa, it's nice to meet you
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.40,0:05:30.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,How can I assist you today?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.00,0:05:38.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Now let's try another example
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.32,0:05:43.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So here our messages are system message
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.72,0:05:45.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,you're a friendly chatbot
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.12,0:05:47.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and the first user message is
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.08,0:05:53.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,yes, can you remind me what is my name?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.88,0:05:56.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Let's get the response
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.40,0:06:01.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,As you can see
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.44,0:06:05.80,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the model doesn't actually know my name
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.80,0:06:10.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So each conversation with a language model is a standalone interaction
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.68,0:06:13.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,which means that you must provide all relevant messages
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.20,0:06:16.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,for the model to draw from in the current conversation
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.12,0:06:18.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,If you want the model to draw from or
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.56,0:06:21.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,quote unquote, remember earlier parts of a conversation
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.24,0:06:24.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,you must provide the earlier exchanges in the input to the model
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.64,0:06:26.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So we'll refer to this as context
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.96,0:06:30.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's try this
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.44,0:06:39.00,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So now we've given the context that the model needs
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.00,0:06:41.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,which is my name in the previous messages
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.60,0:06:43.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and we'll ask the same question
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.16,0:06:45.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So we'll ask what my name is
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.96,0:06:50.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and the model is able to respond because it has all of the context it
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.32,0:06:55.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,needs in this list of messages that we input to it
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.52,0:06:58.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So now you're going to build your own chatbot
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.76,0:07:02.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,This chatbot is going to be called orderbot
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.04,0:07:05.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and we're going to automate the collection of
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.52,0:07:09.48,灰英字,,0,0,0,,user prompts and assistant responses in order to build this orderbot
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.48,0:07:12.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,It's going to take orders at a pizza restaurant
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.20,0:07:16.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So first, we're going to define this helper function
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.04,0:07:19.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,What this is doing is it's going to collect
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.04,0:07:24.84,灰英字,,0,0,0,,our user messages so we can avoid typing them in by hand in the way that we did above
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.84,0:07:29.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,This is going to collect prompts from a user interface that we'll build below
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.76,0:07:32.80,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then append it to a list called context
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.80,0:07:36.28,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then it will call the model with that context every time
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.28,0:07:39.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The model response is then also added to the context
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.32,0:07:43.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So the model message is added to the context
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.56,0:07:45.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the user message is added to the context
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.16,0:07:47.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,so on, so it just grows longer and longer
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.88,0:07:52.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,This way, the model has the information it needs to determine what to do next
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.68,0:07:58.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So now we'll set up and run this UI to display the orderbot
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.60,0:08:00.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So here's the context
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.36,0:08:04.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and it contains the system message that contains the menu
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.56,0:08:08.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Note that every time we call the language model
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.16,0:08:13.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,we're going to use the same context and the context is building up over time
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.40,0:08:19.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Then let's execute this
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.88,0:08:25.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I'm going to say, hi
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.76,0:08:29.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I would like to order a pizza
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.08,0:08:35.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The assistant says, great
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.40,0:08:36.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,what pizza would you like to order?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.88,0:08:40.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,We have pepperoni, cheese, and eggplant pizza
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.52,0:08:44.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,How much are they?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.08,0:08:56.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Great. Okay, we have the prices
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.88,0:09:12.00,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I think I'm feeling a medium eggplant pizza. So as you can imagine
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.00,0:09:14.00,灰英字,,0,0,0,,we could continue this conversation
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.00,0:09:17.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Let's look at what we've put in the system message
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.28,0:09:20.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So you are orderbot
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.40,0:09:23.28,灰英字,,0,0,0,,an automated service to collect orders for a pizza restaurant
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.28,0:09:24.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,You first greet the customer
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.60,0:09:27.80,灰英字,,0,0,0,,then collect the order and then ask if it's a pickup or delivery

Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.04,0:09:40.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Make sure to clarify all options, extras
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.24,0:09:43.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and sizes to uniquely identify the item from the menu
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.12,0:09:44.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,You respond in a short
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.92,0:09:46.84,灰英字,,0,0,0,,very conversational, friendly style
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.84,0:09:50.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The menu includes, and then here we have the menu
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.12,0:09:54.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's go back to our conversation
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.20,0:09:58.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And let's see if the assistant kind of has been following the instructions
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.72,0:10:01.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Okay, great. The assistant asks if we want any toppings
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.72,0:10:05.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,which we kind of specified in the system message
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.76,0:10:09.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So I think we want no extra toppings
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.60,0:10:18.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Sure thing. Is there anything else we'd like to order?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.68,0:10:22.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Hmm. Let's get some water
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.24,0:10:26.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Actually, fries
Dialogue: 0,0:10:32.24,0:10:34.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Small or large?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:34.24,0:10:36.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And this is great because we kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.24,0:10:41.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,ask the assistant in the system message to kind of clarify extras and sides
Dialogue: 0,0:10:46.24,0:10:50.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so you get the idea and please feel free to play with this yourself
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.24,0:10:55.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,You can pause the video and just go ahead and run this in your own notebook on the left
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.24,0:10:59.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so now we can ask the model to create a JSON summary
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.24,0:11:03.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,that we could send to the order system based on the conversation
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.24,0:11:06.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So we're now appending another system message
Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.24,0:11:08.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,which is an instruction
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.24,0:11:11.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And we're saying create a JSON summary of the previous food order
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.24,0:11:13.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Itemize the price for each item
Dialogue: 0,0:11:13.24,0:11:18.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,The fields should be one pizza, include side
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.24,0:11:21.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,two lists of toppings, three lists of drinks
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.24,0:11:23.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and four lists of sides
Dialogue: 0,0:11:23.24,0:11:25.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And finally, the total price
Dialogue: 0,0:11:25.24,0:11:29.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And you could also use a user message here
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.24,0:11:33.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,This does not have to be a system message
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.24,0:11:36.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's execute this
Dialogue: 0,0:11:36.24,0:11:39.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And notice in this case, we're using a lower temperature
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.24,0:11:41.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,because for these kinds of tasks
Dialogue: 0,0:11:41.24,0:11:43.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,we want the output to be fairly predictable
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.24,0:11:47.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,For a conversational agent, you might want to use a higher temperature
Dialogue: 0,0:11:47.24,0:11:50.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,However, in this case, I would maybe use a lower temperature as well
Dialogue: 0,0:11:50.24,0:11:53.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,because for a customer assistant chatbot
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.24,0:11:59.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,you might want the output to be a bit more predictable as well
Dialogue: 0,0:11:59.24,0:12:02.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so here we have the summary of our order
Dialogue: 0,0:12:02.24,0:12:07.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so we could submit this to the order system if we wanted to
Dialogue: 0,0:12:07.24,0:12:08.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So there we have it
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.24,0:12:11.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,You've built your very own order chatbot
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.24,0:12:13.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Feel free to kind of customize it yourself
Dialogue: 0,0:12:13.24,0:12:16.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and play around with the system message
Dialogue: 0,0:12:16.24,0:12:19.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and kind of change the behavior of the chatbot
Dialogue: 0,0:12:19.24,0:12:46.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and get it to act as different personas with different knowledge
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.00,0:00:08.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,关于大语言模型的一个令人兴奋的事情，是你可以用它来
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.60,0:00:12.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,构建一个自定义的聊天机器人，只需花费少量的精力
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.68,0:00:17.66,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,ChatGPT的Web界面能让你通过一个大语言模型
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.66,0:00:20.50,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,进行对话
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.50,0:00:23.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但其中一个很酷的事情是你也可以使用
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.12,0:00:25.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,一个大语言模型来建立你的自定义聊天机器人
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.68,0:00:28.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,也许可以扮演一个AI客户服务代理或
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.92,0:00:31.48,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,餐馆的AI接单员
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.48,0:00:34.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在这段视频中，你将学习如何做这件事
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.40,0:00:37.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我将描述以下内容
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.08,0:00:39.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我将更详细地描述OpenAI的聊天补全格式
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.96,0:00:42.54,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后你将自己建立一个聊天机器人
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.54,0:00:44.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以让我们开始吧
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.40,0:00:49.00,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,首先，我们将像往常一样设置OpenAI Python包
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.00,0:00:53.38,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，像ChatGPT这样的聊天模型实际上是被训练成以一系列的信息作为输入
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.38,0:00:57.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,并返回模型生成的信息作为输出
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.64,0:00:59.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，尽管聊天格式的设计是为了
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.96,0:01:02.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,使得像这样的多轮对话变得容易
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.32,0:01:06.00,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们在之前的视频中已经看到
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.00,0:01:09.56,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,它也适用于没有对话的单个任务
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.56,0:01:14.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以接下来，我们要定义两个辅助函数
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.20,0:01:17.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,就是我们在所有视频中一直在使用的一个
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.08,0:01:20.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,get_completion函数
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.36,0:01:22.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但是，如果你看一下它
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.08,0:01:25.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们给出了一个提示，但是在这个函数里面
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.04,0:01:29.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们实际上在做的是把这个提示放到一个
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.32,0:01:32.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,看起来像某种用户信息
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.16,0:01:37.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这是因为ChatGPT模型是一个聊天模型
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.20,0:01:40.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这意味着它被训练成以一系列信息作为输入
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.20,0:01:44.00,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后返回模型生成的信息输出
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.00,0:01:45.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以用户信息是一种输入
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.88,0:01:49.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后助理的信息是输出
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.32,0:01:51.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以在这个视频中
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.32,0:01:53.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们将使用一个不同的辅助函数
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.76,0:01:55.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,而不是把
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.64,0:01:58.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,单一提示作为输入并获得单一结果
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.40,0:02:01.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们将传入一个信息列表
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.68,0:02:05.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这些信息可以来自各种不同的角色
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.40,0:02:07.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我将描述这些
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.16,0:02:10.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这里有一个消息列表的例子
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.04,0:02:12.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,第一条信息是
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.04,0:02:15.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,一个系统消息，它给出了一个总体指令
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.20,0:02:16.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后在这个消息之后
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.36,0:02:20.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们在用户和助理之间有几轮对话
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.04,0:02:21.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,而且这种对话通常会继续下去
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.92,0:02:24.80,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,如果你曾经使用过ChatGPT的Web界面
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.80,0:02:27.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,那么你输入的信息就是用户信息
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.68,0:02:30.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后ChatGPT的信息是助理的信息
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.88,0:02:33.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，系统信息有助于在某种程度上
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.44,0:02:35.80,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,设定助理的行为和角色
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.80,0:02:38.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,它就像对话的高级指令一样
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.92,0:02:40.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以你可以把它看成是
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.64,0:02:42.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在助理的耳边说的话，并引导
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.44,0:02:46.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,它的反应，而用户并不知道系统的信息
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.32,0:02:47.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，作为用户
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.96,0:02:49.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,如果你曾经使用过ChatGPT
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.40,0:02:52.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你可能不知道ChatGPT的系统消息里有什么
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.64,0:02:55.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,系统消息的好处是
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.36,0:02:57.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,它为开发者提供了一种方法来框定会话
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.24,0:02:59.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,而不是让请求本身
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.12,0:03:01.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,成为对话的一部分
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.32,0:03:04.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这样，你就可以在不让用户察觉的情况下引导助理
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.88,0:03:09.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,并指导其回复
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.28,0:03:15.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以现在让我们试着在对话中使用这些信息
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.08,0:03:19.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我们将使用我们的新助理函数
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.16,0:03:21.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,来补全消息内容
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.60,0:03:27.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,而且我们也在使用更高的temperature
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.20,0:03:29.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以系统消息说
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.40,0:03:31.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你是一个说话像莎士比亚的助理
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.44,0:03:33.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这是我们在向助理描述
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.16,0:03:35.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,向助理描述它应该如何表现
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.96,0:03:38.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后第一个用户信息是，告诉我一个笑话
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.68,0:03:41.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,接下来是，鸡为什么要过马路？
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.64,0:03:45.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后最后的用户信息是，我不知道
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.52,0:03:49.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以，如果我们运行这个
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.60,0:03:55.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,响应是"去到另一边"。让我们再试一次
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.72,0:03:57.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,"要到另一边去"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.92,0:03:59.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,公平的先生或女士
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.24,0:04:02.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这是一个古老而经典的方法，永远不会失败
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.04,0:04:05.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这就是我们的莎士比亚式响应
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.64,0:04:08.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让我们再试一次
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.96,0:04:11.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因为我想让它更清楚，这是助理的信息
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.52,0:04:19.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以在这里，让我们去打印整个消息的回应
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.88,0:04:36.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以只是为了让这个更清楚
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.24,0:04:41.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这个响应是一个助理信息
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.16,0:04:45.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以角色是助理，然后内容是消息本身
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.68,0:04:48.00,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这就是在这个辅助函数中发生的事情
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.00,0:04:51.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们只是传出了消息的内容
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.96,0:05:07.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以现在让我们再做一个例子
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.96,0:05:09.84,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这里我们的消息是
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.84,0:05:13.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,系统信息是你是一个友好的聊天机器人
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.16,0:05:14.56,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,而第一个用户信息是
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.56,0:05:16.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,嗨，我的名字是Isa
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.12,0:05:20.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们想获得第一个用户的信息
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.64,0:05:22.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以让我们执行这个
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.08,0:05:24.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,第一条助理信息
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.64,0:05:26.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，第一条信息是
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.88,0:05:28.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你好，Isa，很高兴见到你
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.40,0:05:30.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我今天有什么可以帮助你的吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.00,0:05:38.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,现在让我们试试另一个例子
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.32,0:05:43.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这里我们的信息是系统信息
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.72,0:05:45.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你是一个友好的聊天机器人
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.12,0:05:47.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,和第一个用户信息是
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.08,0:05:53.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,是的，你能提醒我我的名字是什么吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.88,0:05:56.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让我们得到回应
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.40,0:06:01.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,正如你所看到的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.44,0:06:05.80,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,该模型实际上并不知道我的名字
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.80,0:06:10.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，与语言模型的每一次对话都是一个独立的互动
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.68,0:06:13.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这意味着，你必须提供所有相关的信息
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.20,0:06:16.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,供模型在当前对话中使用
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.12,0:06:18.56,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,如果你想让模型从或中汲取
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.56,0:06:21.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,引述，记住一个对话的早期部分
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.24,0:06:24.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你必须在模型的输入中提供早期的对话交互内容
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.64,0:06:26.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们也把这称为上下文
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.96,0:06:30.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以，让我们来试试这个
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.44,0:06:39.00,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以现在我们已经给出了模型需要的上下文
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.00,0:06:41.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这是我在以前的信息中的名字
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.60,0:06:43.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们将问同样的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.16,0:06:45.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我们会问我的名字是什么
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.96,0:06:50.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,模型能够作出反应，因为它有所有的上下文
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.32,0:06:55.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在我们输入的消息列表中需要它
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.52,0:06:58.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以现在你要建立你自己的聊天机器人
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.76,0:07:02.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这个聊天机器人将被称为orderbot（点餐机器人）
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.04,0:07:05.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们将自动收集
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.52,0:07:09.48,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们将自动收集用户的提示和助理的回应，以建立这个订单机器人
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.48,0:07:12.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,它将在一家披萨店接受订单
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.20,0:07:16.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以首先，我们要定义这个助理函数
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.04,0:07:19.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这个函数要做的是收集
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.04,0:07:24.84,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们的用户信息，这样我们就可以避免像上面那样用手输入信息了
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.84,0:07:29.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这将从我们下面建立的用户界面上收集提示信息
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.76,0:07:32.80,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后将其追加到一个叫做"上下文"的列表中
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.80,0:07:36.28,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后它每次都会用这个上下文调用模型
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.28,0:07:39.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后模型的响应也会被添加到上下文中
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.32,0:07:43.56,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以模型的信息被添加到上下文中
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.56,0:07:45.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,用户信息被添加到上下文中
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.16,0:07:47.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,以此类推，它只会越来越长
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.88,0:07:52.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这样一来，模型就有了它所需要的信息来决定下一步该做什么
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.68,0:07:58.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,现在我们将设置并运行这个用户界面来显示订单机器人
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.60,0:08:00.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这里是上下文
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.36,0:08:04.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,并且它包含了包含菜单的系统信息
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.56,0:08:08.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,请注意，每次我们调用语言模型的时候
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.16,0:08:13.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们都会使用相同的上下文，而且这个上下文是随着时间的推移而建立的
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.40,0:08:19.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后让我们来执行这个
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.88,0:08:25.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我要说，你好
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.76,0:08:29.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我想订购一个比萨饼
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.08,0:08:35.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,助理说，太好了
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.40,0:08:36.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你想点什么比萨饼？
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.88,0:08:40.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们有意大利香肠、奶酪和茄子比萨
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.52,0:08:44.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,多少钱？
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.08,0:08:56.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,很好。好的，我们得到了价格
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.88,0:09:12.00,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我想我觉得是中号茄子比萨。所以你可以想象
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.00,0:09:14.00,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们可以继续这个对话
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.00,0:09:17.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让我们看看我们在系统信息中放了什么
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.28,0:09:20.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以你是orderbot
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.40,0:09:23.28,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,为一家比萨店收集订单的自动化服务
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.28,0:09:24.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你首先要问候顾客
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.60,0:09:27.80,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后收集订单，再问是自取还是配送
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.80,0:09:29.48,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你等待收集整个订单
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.48,0:09:31.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后总结一下，最后进行检查
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.68,0:09:33.80,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,如果顾客还想添加其他东西
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.80,0:09:36.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,如果是送货，你可以要求提供地址
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.40,0:09:38.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,最后，你拿到付款
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.04,0:09:40.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,确保清晰描述所有选项、附加服务、额外费用
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.24,0:09:43.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,和尺寸，以便从菜单上精确识别该项目
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.12,0:09:44.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你需要以简短的
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.92,0:09:46.84,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,健谈的、友好的风格来回答
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.84,0:09:50.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,菜单包括，然后在这里我们有菜单
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.12,0:09:54.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以让我们回到我们的对话
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.20,0:09:58.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让我们看看助理是否一直在遵循指示
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.72,0:10:01.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,好的，很好。助理问我们是否需要任何配料
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.72,0:10:05.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们在系统信息中指定了这一点
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.76,0:10:09.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我想我们不需要额外的配料
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.60,0:10:18.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,当然可以。还有什么我们想点的吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.68,0:10:22.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,嗯。让我们来点水
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.24,0:10:26.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,事实上，薯条
Dialogue: 0,0:10:32.24,0:10:34.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,小的还是大的？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:34.24,0:10:36.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这很好，因为我们在系统信息中
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.24,0:10:41.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,要求助理在系统信息中说明额外的东西和配菜
Dialogue: 0,0:10:46.24,0:10:50.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这样你就明白了，你可以随意试玩一下这个过程
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.24,0:10:55.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,可以暂停视频，在左边的Notebook上运行这个
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.24,0:10:59.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,现在我们可以要求该模型创建一个JSON摘要
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.24,0:11:03.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们可以在对话的基础上发送至订单系统
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.24,0:11:06.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以，我们现在要附加另一个系统消息
Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.24,0:11:08.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这是一个指令
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.24,0:11:11.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们在说创建一个关于之前食品订单的JSON摘要
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.24,0:11:13.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,逐项列出每一项的价格
Dialogue: 0,0:11:13.24,0:11:18.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,字段应该是一个比萨饼，包括配菜
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.24,0:11:21.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,两张配料表，三张饮料表
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.24,0:11:23.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,和四份配菜清单
Dialogue: 0,0:11:23.24,0:11:25.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,最后是总价格
Dialogue: 0,0:11:25.24,0:11:29.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你也可以在这里使用一个用户信息
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.24,0:11:33.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这不一定是一个系统消息
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.24,0:11:36.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以让我们来执行这个
Dialogue: 0,0:11:36.24,0:11:39.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,注意在这种情况下，我们需要使用更低的temperature
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.24,0:11:41.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因为对于这些类型的任务
Dialogue: 0,0:11:41.24,0:11:43.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们希望输出是相当可预测的
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.24,0:11:47.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,对于一个对话式的代理，你可能想使用更高的temperature
Dialogue: 0,0:11:47.24,0:11:50.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然而，在这种情况下，我可能也会使用一个较低的temperature
Dialogue: 0,0:11:50.24,0:11:53.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因为对于一个客户助理聊天机器人来说
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.24,0:11:59.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你可能想让输出更可预测一些
Dialogue: 0,0:11:59.24,0:12:02.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，在这里我们有我们的订单摘要
Dialogue: 0,0:12:02.24,0:12:07.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,如果我们想的话，我们可以把这个提交给订单系统
Dialogue: 0,0:12:07.24,0:12:08.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这就是我们需要的
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.24,0:12:11.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你已经建立了你自己的订单聊天机器人
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.24,0:12:13.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你可以自由地定制它
Dialogue: 0,0:12:13.24,0:12:16.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,试玩一下系统信息
Dialogue: 0,0:12:16.24,0:12:19.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,并改变聊天机器人的行为
Dialogue: 0,0:12:19.24,0:12:46.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让它作为具有不同知识的不同角色行事
