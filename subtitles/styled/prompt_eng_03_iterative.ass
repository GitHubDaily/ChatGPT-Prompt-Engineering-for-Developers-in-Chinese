Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.00,0:00:08.06,灰英字,,0,0,0,,When I've been building applications with large language models
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.06,0:00:10.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I don't think I've ever come to the prompt that I ended up
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.24,0:00:13.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,using in the final application on my first attempt
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.56,0:00:15.18,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And this isn't what matters
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.18,0:00:19.86,灰英字,,0,0,0,,As long as you have a good process to iteratively make your prompt better
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.86,0:00:22.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,then you'll be able to come to something that
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.10,0:00:24.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,works well for the task you want to achieve
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.68,0:00:28.00,灰英字,,0,0,0,,You may have heard me say that when I train a machine learning model
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.00,0:00:29.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,it almost never works the first time
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.92,0:00:33.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,In fact, I'm very surprised that the first model I trained works
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.36,0:00:37.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I think we're prompting, the odds of it working the first time is maybe a little bit
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.16,0:00:39.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,higher but as she's saying
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.64,0:00:42.06,灰英字,,0,0,0,,doesn't matter if the first prompt works
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.06,0:00:46.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,what matters most is the process for getting to prompts that works for your application
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.64,0:00:49.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So with that, let's jump into the code and let me show you
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.52,0:00:53.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,some frameworks to think about how to iteratively develop a prompt
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.68,0:00:57.84,灰英字,,0,0,0,,All right. So if you've taken a machine learning class with me
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.84,0:01:02.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,before you may have seen me use a diagram saying that with machine learning development
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.76,0:01:06.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,you often have an idea and then implement it
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.44,0:01:08.78,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So write the code, get the data
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.78,0:01:12.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,train your model and that gives you an experimental result
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.72,0:01:14.38,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And you can then look at that output
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.38,0:01:16.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,maybe do error analysis
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.08,0:01:17.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,figure out where it's working or not working
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.76,0:01:19.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then maybe even change your idea of
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.76,0:01:23.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,exactly what problem you want to solve or how to approach it
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.12,0:01:25.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And then change implementation and run
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.68,0:01:27.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,another experiment and so on and iterate over and
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.92,0:01:31.10,灰英字,,0,0,0,,over to get to an effective machine learning model
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.10,0:01:33.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,If you're not familiar with machine learning
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.16,0:01:35.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,haven't seen this diagram before, don't worry about it
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.24,0:01:38.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Not that important for the rest of this presentation
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.20,0:01:44.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But when you are writing prompts to develop an application using an LLM
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.88,0:01:48.30,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the process can be quite similar
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.30,0:01:50.58,灰英字,,0,0,0,,where you have an idea for what you want to do
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.58,0:01:52.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the task you want to complete
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.04,0:01:55.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and you can then take a first attempt at writing
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.88,0:01:59.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,a prompt that hopefully is clear and specific
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.40,0:02:01.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and maybe if appropriate
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.56,0:02:04.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,gives the system time to think
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.12,0:02:07.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And then you can run it and see what result you get
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.76,0:02:10.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And if it doesn't work well enough the first time
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.12,0:02:13.84,灰英字,,0,0,0,,then the iterative process of figuring out why the instructions
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.84,0:02:15.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,for example, were not clear enough or why it
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.96,0:02:17.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,didn't give the algorithm enough time to think
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.76,0:02:19.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,allows you to refine the idea
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.36,0:02:21.26,灰英字,,0,0,0,,refine the prompt, and so on
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.26,0:02:23.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and to go around this loop multiple times
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.24,0:02:26.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,until you end up with a prompt that works for your application
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.20,0:02:32.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,This too is why I personally have not paid as much attention to
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.32,0:02:35.84,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the Internet articles that say 30 perfect prompts because I think
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.84,0:02:39.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,there probably isn't a perfect prompt for everything under the sun
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.72,0:02:42.00,灰英字,,0,0,0,,It's more important that you have a process for
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.00,0:02:45.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,developing a good prompt for your specific application
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.44,0:02:49.00,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's look at an example together in code
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.00,0:02:51.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I have here the starter code that you saw in
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.40,0:02:54.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the previous videos have been import openai and port is
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.44,0:02:58.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Here we get the OpenAI API key
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.24,0:03:02.28,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and this is the same helper function that you saw as last time
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.28,0:03:08.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to use as the running example in this video
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.44,0:03:12.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the task of summarizing a fact sheet for a chair
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.68,0:03:16.28,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let me just paste that in here
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.28,0:03:19.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and feel free to pause the video and read
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.72,0:03:23.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,this more carefully in the notebook on the left if you want
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.12,0:03:26.80,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But here's a fact sheet for a chair with a description saying it's part of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.80,0:03:30.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,a beautiful family of mid-century inspired and so on
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.32,0:03:31.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,talks about the construction
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.92,0:03:34.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,has the dimensions, options for the chair
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.68,0:03:38.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,materials, and so on. It comes from Italy
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.24,0:03:42.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's say you want to take this fact sheet and help
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.96,0:03:47.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,a marketing team write a description for an online retail website
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.88,0:03:50.84,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Let me just quickly run these three
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.84,0:03:57.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then we'll come up with a prompt as follows
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.76,0:04:01.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I'll just paste this in
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.44,0:04:03.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So my prompt here says
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.40,0:04:05.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,your task is to help a marketing team create
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.88,0:04:08.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,a description for a retail website or product based on a techno fact sheet
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.96,0:04:11.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,write a product description, and so on
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.20,0:04:16.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So this is my first attempt to explain the task to the large language model
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.88,0:04:19.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let me hit Shift Enter
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.08,0:04:22.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and this takes a few seconds to run
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.36,0:04:25.00,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and we get this result
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.00,0:04:29.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,It looks like it's done a nice job writing a description
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.20,0:04:31.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,introducing a stunning mid-century inspired office chair
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.60,0:04:33.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,perfect addition, and so on
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.56,0:04:34.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But when I look at this, I go
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.92,0:04:36.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,boy, this is really long
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.56,0:04:39.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,It's done a nice job doing exactly what I asked it to
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.60,0:04:44.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,which is start from the technical fact sheet and write a product description
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.68,0:04:46.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But when I look at this, I go
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.76,0:04:50.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,this is long, maybe we want it to be a little bit shorter
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.36,0:04:52.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So I had an idea
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.92,0:04:54.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I wrote a prompt, got a result
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.72,0:04:56.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I'm not that happy with it because it's too long
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.88,0:05:02.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So I will then clarify my prompt
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.12,0:05:10.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,um, and say, use at most 50 words to try to give
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.08,0:05:15.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,better guidance on the desired length of this and let's run it again
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.28,0:05:24.80,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Okay. This actually looks like a much nicer short description of, uh
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.80,0:05:28.48,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the product introducing a mid-century inspired office chair, and so on
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.48,0:05:29.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,5-wheel base, yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.92,0:05:31.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,both stylish and practical
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.56,0:05:37.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Not bad. Um, and let me double-check the length that this is
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.44,0:05:39.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to take the response, split it
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.72,0:05:41.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,according to where the space is
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.04,0:05:42.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then, you know, print out the length
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.76,0:05:43.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So it's 52 words
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.92,0:05:45.00,灰英字,,0,0,0,,It's actually not bad
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.00,0:05:48.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Um, large language models are okay
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.60,0:05:53.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,but not that great at following instructions about a very precise word count
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.36,0:05:54.48,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But this is actually not bad
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.48,0:05:58.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Sometimes it will print out something with 60 or 65 and so on words
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.96,0:06:01.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,but it's kind of within reason
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.36,0:06:04.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Some of the things you could try to do would be
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.08,0:06:09.48,灰英字,,0,0,0,,um, to say, use at most three sentences
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.16,0:06:16.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Let me run that again
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.44,0:06:18.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But these are different ways to tell
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.52,0:06:21.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the large language model what's the length of the output that you want
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.88,0:06:25.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So this is 1, 2, 3
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.12,0:06:26.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I count three sentences
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.20,0:06:28.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,It looks like I did a pretty good job
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.20,0:06:32.28,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Um, and then I've also seen people sometimes do things like
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.28,0:06:35.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,uh, I don't know, use at most 280 characters
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.92,0:06:40.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Large language models, because of the way they interpret text
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.04,0:06:41.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,using something called a tokenizer
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.68,0:06:43.26,灰英字,,0,0,0,,which I won't talk about
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.26,0:06:47.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But, um, they tend to be so-so at counting characters
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.76,0:06:51.48,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But let's see, 281 characters
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.48,0:06:52.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,It's actually surprisingly close
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.72,0:06:56.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Usually a large language model is- doesn't get it quite this close
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.32,0:06:57.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But these are different ways
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.52,0:07:01.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,They can play with to try to control the length of the output that you get
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.40,0:07:06.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But let me just switch it back to use at most 50 words
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.12,0:07:11.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And there's that result that we had just now
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.96,0:07:15.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,As we continue to refine this text for our websites
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.60,0:07:18.40,灰英字,,0,0,0,,we might decide that, boy
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.40,0:07:21.90,灰英字,,0,0,0,,this website isn't selling direct to consumers
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.90,0:07:25.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,is actually intended to sell furniture to
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.08,0:07:28.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,furniture retailers that would be more interested in
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.72,0:07:32.48,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the technical details of the chair and the materials of the chair
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.48,0:07:35.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,In that case, you can take this prompt and say
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.16,0:07:41.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I want to modify this prompt to get it to be more precise about the technical details
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.88,0:07:46.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let me keep on modifying this prompt
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.24,0:07:50.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to say, this description is intended for furniture retailers
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.96,0:07:52.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,so should be technical and focus on materials
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.88,0:07:55.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,products and constructed from
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.12,0:07:57.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Let's run that
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.64,0:08:00.84,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And let's see
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.84,0:08:03.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Not bad, says, you know
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.04,0:08:08.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,coated aluminum base and pneumatic chair, high quality materials
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.12,0:08:10.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So by changing the prompt
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.08,0:08:14.28,灰英字,,0,0,0,,you can get it to focus more on specific characters
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.28,0:08:17.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,on specific characteristics you wanted to
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.20,0:08:19.84,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And when I look at this
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.84,0:08:23.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I might decide at the end of the description
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.20,0:08:28.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I also wanted to include the product IDs
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.36,0:08:30.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So the two offerings of this chair
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.08,0:08:33.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,SWC 110, SWC 100
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.32,0:08:39.28,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So maybe I can further improve this prompt
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.28,0:08:41.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And to get it to give me the product IDs
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.92,0:08:44.76,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I can add this instruction at the end of the description
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.76,0:08:48.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,include every seven character product ID in the technical specification
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.32,0:08:53.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And let's run it and see what happens
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.64,0:08:57.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so it says, introduce your administration's file office chair
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.88,0:09:02.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,shell colors, talks about plastic coating, aluminum base
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.52,0:09:05.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,practical, some options
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.96,0:09:08.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,talks about the two product IDs
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.08,0:09:10.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So this looks pretty good
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.08,0:09:14.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And what you've just seen is a short example of the iterative
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.52,0:09:18.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,prompt development that many developers will go through
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.92,0:09:22.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And I think a guideline is
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.08,0:09:26.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,in the last video, you saw Isa share a number of best practices
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.52,0:09:30.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so what I usually do is keep best practices like that in mind
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.64,0:09:33.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,be clear and specific, and if necessary
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.08,0:09:35.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,give the model time to think
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.16,0:09:39.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,With those in mind, it's worthwhile to often take a first attempt at writing a prompt
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.88,0:09:44.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,see what happens, and then go from there to iteratively refine the prompt to get
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.88,0:09:49.48,灰英字,,0,0,0,,closer and closer to the results that you need
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.48,0:09:53.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so a lot of the successful prompts that you may see used in various programs
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.92,0:09:58.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,was arrived at at an iterative process like this
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.60,0:10:04.04,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Just for fun, let me show you an example of a even more complex prompt that might
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.04,0:10:07.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,give you a sense of what ChatGPT can do
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.60,0:10:11.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,which is I've just added a few extra instructions here
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.36,0:10:14.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,After the description, include a table that gives the product dimensions
Dialogue: 0,0:10:14.88,0:10:17.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then, you know, format everything as HTML
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.16,0:10:20.88,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So let's run that
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.88,0:10:24.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And in practice, you would end up with a prompt like this
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.56,0:10:26.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,really only after multiple iterations
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.72,0:10:31.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I don't think I know anyone that would write this exact prompt the first time
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.36,0:10:35.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,they were trying to get the system to process a fact sheet
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.56,0:10:40.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And so this actually outputs a bunch of HTML
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.16,0:10:47.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Let's display the HTML to see if this is even valid HTML and see if this works
Dialogue: 0,0:10:47.08,0:10:49.68,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And I don't actually know it's going to work, but let's see
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.68,0:10:50.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Oh, cool. All right
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.64,0:10:51.92,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Looks like it rendered
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.92,0:10:55.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So it has this really nice looking description of a chair
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.96,0:11:01.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,construction, materials, product dimensions
Dialogue: 0,0:11:01.56,0:11:07.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Oh, it looks like I left out the use at most 50 words instruction
Dialogue: 0,0:11:07.24,0:11:09.44,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So this is a little bit long, but if you want that, you know
Dialogue: 0,0:11:09.44,0:11:11.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,you can even feel free to pause the video
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.96,0:11:17.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,tell it to be more succinct and regenerate this and see what results you get
Dialogue: 0,0:11:17.16,0:11:20.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So I hope you take away from this video that
Dialogue: 0,0:11:20.20,0:11:22.72,灰英字,,0,0,0,,prompt development is an iterative process
Dialogue: 0,0:11:22.72,0:11:27.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,Try something, see how it does not yet fulfill exactly what you want
Dialogue: 0,0:11:27.24,0:11:30.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and then think about how to clarify your instructions
Dialogue: 0,0:11:30.32,0:11:33.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,or in some cases, think about how to give it more space to think
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.96,0:11:38.20,灰英字,,0,0,0,,to get it closer to delivering the results that you want
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.20,0:11:42.84,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And I think the key to being an effective prompt engineer
Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.84,0:11:46.48,灰英字,,0,0,0,,isn't so much about knowing the perfect prompt
Dialogue: 0,0:11:46.48,0:11:49.08,灰英字,,0,0,0,,it's about having a good process to develop
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.08,0:11:52.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,prompts that are effective for your application
Dialogue: 0,0:11:52.60,0:11:58.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,And in this video, I illustrated developing a prompt using just one example
Dialogue: 0,0:11:58.32,0:12:00.96,灰英字,,0,0,0,,For more sophisticated applications
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.96,0:12:04.64,灰英字,,0,0,0,,sometimes you will have multiple examples
Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.64,0:12:09.36,灰英字,,0,0,0,,say a list of 10 or even 50 or 100 fact sheets
Dialogue: 0,0:12:09.36,0:12:17.28,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and iteratively develop a prompt and evaluate it against a large set of cases
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.28,0:12:21.28,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But for the early development of most applications
Dialogue: 0,0:12:21.28,0:12:26.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,I see many people developing it sort of the way I am with just one example
Dialogue: 0,0:12:26.56,0:12:28.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But then for more mature applications
Dialogue: 0,0:12:28.52,0:12:35.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,sometimes it could be useful to evaluate prompts against a larger set of examples
Dialogue: 0,0:12:35.12,0:12:40.16,灰英字,,0,0,0,,such as to test different prompts on dozens of fact sheets to see
Dialogue: 0,0:12:40.16,0:12:44.12,灰英字,,0,0,0,,how is average or worst case performances on multiple fact sheets
Dialogue: 0,0:12:44.12,0:12:48.80,灰英字,,0,0,0,,But usually, you end up doing that only when an application is more mature
Dialogue: 0,0:12:48.80,0:12:50.60,灰英字,,0,0,0,,and you have to have those metrics to drive
Dialogue: 0,0:12:50.60,0:12:54.56,灰英字,,0,0,0,,that incremental last few steps of prompt improvement
Dialogue: 0,0:12:54.56,0:12:57.52,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So with that, please do play with
Dialogue: 0,0:12:57.52,0:13:00.24,灰英字,,0,0,0,,the Jupyter Code notebook examples and try out
Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.24,0:13:03.32,灰英字,,0,0,0,,different variations and see what results you get

Dialogue: 0,0:13:15.48,0:13:25.48,灰英字,,0,0,0,,So when you're ready, let's go on to the next video
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.00,0:00:08.06,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,当我一直在用大型语言模型构建应用程序时
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.06,0:00:10.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我想我从来没有在第一次尝试时

Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.56,0:00:15.18,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因为这并不是最重要的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.18,0:00:19.86,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,只要你有一个好的迭代过程，能让你的提示语变得更好
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.86,0:00:22.10,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,那么你就能找到一些
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.10,0:00:24.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,对任务实现效果较好的提示词
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.68,0:00:28.00,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你可能听我说过，当我训练一个机器学习模型时
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.00,0:00:29.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,它几乎从来没有第一次就成功过
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.92,0:00:33.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,事实上，我很惊讶我训练的第一个模型能起作用
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.36,0:00:37.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我认为我们在使用提示时，它第一次工作的几率可能会高一点
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.16,0:00:39.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但正如她所说
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.64,0:00:42.06,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,第一次提示是否有效并不重要
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.06,0:00:46.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,最重要的是获得提示的过程对你的应用有用
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.64,0:00:49.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，让我们跳进代码，让我向你展示
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.52,0:00:53.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,一些框架来思考如何迭代开发一个提示
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.68,0:00:57.84,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,好的。如果你以前和我一起上过机器学习课
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.84,0:01:02.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你可能见过我用一张图说，在机器学习开发中
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.76,0:01:06.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你经常有一个想法，然后实现它
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.44,0:01:08.78,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以写代码，获取数据
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.78,0:01:12.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,训练你的模型，这就给了你一个实验性的结果
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.72,0:01:14.38,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后你就可以看一下这个输出
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.38,0:01:16.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,也许做错误分析
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.08,0:01:17.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,找出它在什么地方起作用或不起作用
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.76,0:01:19.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后甚至可能改变你的想法
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.76,0:01:23.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你想解决什么问题或如何处理它
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.12,0:01:25.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后改变实施方案
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.68,0:01:27.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,运行另一个实验等等，如此反复
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.92,0:01:31.10,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,来得到 一个有效的机器学习模型
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.10,0:01:33.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,如果你对机器学习不熟悉
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.16,0:01:35.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,没见过这张图，不用担心
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.24,0:01:38.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,对于本演讲的其余部分来说，并不那么重要
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.20,0:01:44.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但是当你在写提示，使用LLM开发一个应用程序时
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.88,0:01:48.30,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这个过程可以说是非常相似的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.30,0:01:50.58,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你有一个关于你想做什么的想法

Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.56,0:02:04.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,给予系统思考的时间
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.12,0:02:07.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后你可以运行它，看看你得到什么结果
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.76,0:02:10.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,如果第一次的效果不够好
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.12,0:02:13.84,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,那么，就需要反复的过程来弄清楚为什么指令
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.84,0:02:15.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,例如，为什么指令不够清楚，或者为什么它
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.96,0:02:17.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,为什么没有给算法足够的时间来思考
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.76,0:02:19.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这样你就可以完善这个想法了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.36,0:02:21.26,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,完善提示，以此类推
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.26,0:02:23.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,并在此基础上进行多次循环

Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.20,0:02:32.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这也是为什么我个人没有那么多关注
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.32,0:02:35.84,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,网上那些说有30个完美提示词的文章，因为我认为
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.84,0:02:39.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,可能没有一个完美的提示适用于世间万物
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.72,0:02:42.00,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,更重要的是，你要有一个过程，用于
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.00,0:02:45.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,为你的特定应用挖掘出一个好的提示
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.44,0:02:49.00,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，让我们一起看下一个代码中的例子
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.00,0:02:51.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,前面的视频中你所看到的初始代码
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.40,0:02:54.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,已导入了openai和os

Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.28,0:03:08.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在这个视频中，我将使用这个例子
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.44,0:03:12.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,为一张椅子写一份信息表
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.68,0:03:16.28,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以让我把它粘贴在这里

Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.12,0:03:26.80,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但这里是一份椅子情况说明，上面写着
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.80,0:03:30.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,它的灵感来自于一个华丽中世纪家族，等等
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.32,0:03:31.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,谈到了结构
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.92,0:03:34.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,有尺寸，椅子的选择
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.68,0:03:38.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,材料等等。它来自意大利
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.24,0:03:42.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，假设你想拿着这份概况介绍，帮助营销团队
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.96,0:03:47.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,为在线零售网站编写一份描述
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.88,0:03:50.84,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让我快速运行这三个
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.84,0:03:57.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后我们会有如下的提示
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.76,0:04:01.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我就把这个粘贴进去
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.44,0:04:03.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我的提示是在这里说
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.40,0:04:05.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你的任务是基于一份技术性的信息表
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.88,0:04:08.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,帮助一个营销团队，为零售网站

Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.20,0:04:16.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这是我第一次尝试向大语言模型解释任务
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.88,0:04:19.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，让我点击Shift Enter
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.08,0:04:22.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,而这需要几秒钟的时间来运行
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.36,0:04:25.00,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后我们得到这个结果
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.00,0:04:29.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,看起来它已经完成了一个很好的描述工作
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.20,0:04:31.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,介绍一个令人惊叹的中世纪风格的办公椅

Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.68,0:04:46.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但是，当我看到这个时，我就会说
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.76,0:04:50.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,内容有点长，也许我们希望它能短一点
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.36,0:04:52.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我有一个想法
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.92,0:04:54.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我写了一个提示，得到了一个结果
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.72,0:04:56.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我对它不是那么满意，因为它太长了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.88,0:05:02.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，我将让提示更清晰
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.12,0:05:10.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,嗯，并说，最多使用50个字，以尝试提供
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.08,0:05:15.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,更好地指导所需的长度，然后我们再运行一次
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.28,0:05:24.80,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,好的。这实际上看起来是一个更好的简短描述，呃
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.80,0:05:28.48,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,介绍一个中世纪风格的办公椅的产品，诸如此类
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.48,0:05:29.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,5个轮子支撑，对
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.92,0:05:31.56,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,既时尚又实用
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.56,0:05:37.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,不错。嗯，让我再检查一下这个的长度是多少
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.44,0:05:39.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以我打算把答复，拆开来
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.72,0:05:41.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,根据空间的位置
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.04,0:05:42.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后，你知道，打印出长度
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.76,0:05:43.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以它是52个字
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.92,0:05:45.00,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这其实还不错
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.00,0:05:48.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,嗯，这大语言模型还不错
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.60,0:05:53.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但在遵循关于非常精确的字数的指示方面，效果就不是那么好
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.36,0:05:54.48,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但这实际上还不错
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.48,0:05:58.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,有时它会打印出60或65个单词长度的内容
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.96,0:06:01.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但这是在合理范围内的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.36,0:06:04.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你可以尝试做的一些事情是
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.08,0:06:09.48,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,嗯，就是说，最多使用三个句子
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.16,0:06:16.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让我再试一次
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.44,0:06:18.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但这些都是不同的方式来告诉
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.52,0:06:21.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这些是告诉大型语言模型你想要的输出的长度的不同方法
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.88,0:06:25.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这是1、2、3
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.12,0:06:26.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我数了一下有三个句子
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.20,0:06:28.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,看起来我做得很好
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.20,0:06:32.28,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,嗯，然后我也看到人们有时会做一些事情，比如
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.28,0:06:35.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,呃，我不知道，最多使用280个字符
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.92,0:06:40.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,大语言模型，因为它们解释文本的方式
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.04,0:06:41.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,是使用一种叫做标记器的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.68,0:06:43.26,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这我就不说了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.26,0:06:47.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但是，嗯，他们在计算字符方面往往很一般
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.76,0:06:51.48,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但是让我们看看，281个字符
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.48,0:06:52.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这实际上是出乎意料的接近
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.72,0:06:56.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,通常情况下，一个大语言模型是无法达到这么接近的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.32,0:06:57.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但这些是不同的方法
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.52,0:07:01.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,他们可以尝试控制你得到的输出的长度
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.40,0:07:06.56,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但是，让我把它切换回最多使用50个词
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.12,0:07:11.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这就是我们刚才的结果
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.96,0:07:15.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,当我们继续为我们的网站完善这个文本时
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.60,0:07:18.40,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们可能会决定，孩子
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.40,0:07:21.90,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这个网站并不是直接面向消费者销售的
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.90,0:07:25.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,实际上是要把家具卖给
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.08,0:07:28.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,家具零售商，他们会对以下方面更感兴趣
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.72,0:07:32.48,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,椅子的技术细节和椅子的材料
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.48,0:07:35.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在这种情况下，你可以拿着这个提示说
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.16,0:07:41.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我想修改这个提示，让它对技术细节更加精确
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.88,0:07:46.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以让我继续修改这个提示
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.24,0:07:50.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,而我要说的是，这个描述是为家具零售商准备的
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.96,0:07:52.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以应该更偏向技术，专注于材料
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.88,0:07:55.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,产品和构造
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.12,0:07:57.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让我们运行这个
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.64,0:08:00.84,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让我们看看
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.84,0:08:03.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,还不错，你知道
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.04,0:08:08.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,涂层铝基和气动椅，高质量的材料
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.12,0:08:10.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，通过改变提示
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.08,0:08:14.28,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你可以让它更专注于特定内容
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.28,0:08:17.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在你想要的特定特征上
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.20,0:08:19.84,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,而当我看这个的时候
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.84,0:08:23.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我可能会决定在描述的最后
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.20,0:08:28.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我也想包括产品的ID
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.36,0:08:30.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这把椅子的两个产品
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.08,0:08:33.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,SWC 110，SWC 100
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.32,0:08:39.28,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，也许我可以进一步改进这个提示
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.28,0:08:41.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,并让它给我产品的ID
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.92,0:08:44.76,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我可以在描述的末尾添加这个指令
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.76,0:08:48.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在技术规范中，用7个字符来描述每一个产品ID
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.32,0:08:53.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后让我们运行它，看看会发生什么
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.64,0:08:57.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,于是它说，介绍你的行政部门的文件办公椅
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.88,0:09:02.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,外壳颜色，谈到塑料涂层，铝制底座
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.52,0:09:05.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,实用性，一些选项
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.96,0:09:08.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,谈到了两个产品ID
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.08,0:09:10.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这看起来很不错
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.08,0:09:14.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,而你刚才看到的是一个简短的迭代例子
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.52,0:09:18.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,提示开发的一个简短例子，许多开发者都会经历
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.92,0:09:22.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,而我认为一个准则是
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.08,0:09:26.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在上一个视频中，你看到Isa分享了一些最佳做法
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.52,0:09:30.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，我通常所做的是将这样的最佳实践铭记在心
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.64,0:09:33.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,清楚和具体，如果有必要的话
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.08,0:09:35.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,给予模型思考的时间
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.16,0:09:39.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,考虑到这些，经常在写提示时进行第一次尝试是值得的
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.88,0:09:44.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,看看会发生什么，然后再从那里反复完善提示，以获得
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.88,0:09:49.48,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,越来越接近你需要的结果
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.48,0:09:53.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，你可能会看到在各种项目中使用的许多成功的提示语
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.92,0:09:58.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,是通过这样的迭代过程得出的
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.60,0:10:04.04,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,为了好玩，让我给你看一个更复杂的提示的例子，它可以
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.04,0:10:07.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让你感受一下ChatGPT的功能
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.60,0:10:11.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我只是在这里添加了一些额外的指令
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.36,0:10:14.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在描述之后，包括一个给出产品尺寸的表格
Dialogue: 0,0:10:14.88,0:10:17.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后，把所有东西都格式化为HTML
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.16,0:10:20.88,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以，让我们再次运行
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.88,0:10:24.56,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在实践中，你最终会得到这样的提示
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.56,0:10:26.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,其实只有在多次反复之后才会出现
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.72,0:10:31.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我想我不知道有谁会在第一次就写出这样准确的提示语
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.36,0:10:35.56,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,他们试图让系统处理一个信息表
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.56,0:10:40.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，这实际上输出了一堆HTML
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.16,0:10:47.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让我们显示一下HTML，看看这是否是有效的HTML，看看这是否有效
Dialogue: 0,0:10:47.08,0:10:49.68,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我不知道它是否能工作，但让我们看看
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.68,0:10:50.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,哦，太好了。不错
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.64,0:10:51.92,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,看来它成功渲染了
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.92,0:10:55.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以它有一个非常漂亮的椅子描述
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.96,0:11:01.56,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,结构、材料、产品尺寸
Dialogue: 0,0:11:01.56,0:11:07.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,哦，看来我漏掉了最多使用50个字的说明
Dialogue: 0,0:11:07.24,0:11:09.44,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以这有点长，但如果你想要调整的话
Dialogue: 0,0:11:09.44,0:11:11.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你可以随意暂停视频
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.96,0:11:17.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,告诉它要更简洁，并重新生成这个，看看你得到什么结果
Dialogue: 0,0:11:17.16,0:11:20.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，我希望你能从这个视频中得到启发，即
Dialogue: 0,0:11:20.20,0:11:22.72,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,提示开发是一个迭代的过程
Dialogue: 0,0:11:22.72,0:11:27.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,尝试一些东西，看看它如何还不能完全满足你的要求
Dialogue: 0,0:11:27.24,0:11:30.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,然后再考虑如何更清楚地描述指示
Dialogue: 0,0:11:30.32,0:11:33.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,或者在某些情况下，考虑如何给它更多的空间来思考
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.96,0:11:38.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,以使它更接近于提供你想要的结果
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.20,0:11:42.84,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我认为成为一个有效的提示工程师的关键在于
Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.84,0:11:46.48,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,他并不在于知道完美的提示
Dialogue: 0,0:11:46.48,0:11:49.08,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但了解如何用一个更好过程来开发提示
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.08,0:11:52.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,让应用能够更加高效
Dialogue: 0,0:11:52.60,0:11:58.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在这段视频中，我只用一个例子说明了开发提示语
Dialogue: 0,0:11:58.32,0:12:00.96,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,对于更复杂的应用
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.96,0:12:04.64,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,有时你会有多个例子
Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.64,0:12:09.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,例如，一个有10个或甚至50个或100个信息表的列表
Dialogue: 0,0:12:09.36,0:12:17.28,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,迭代开发一个提示，并根据大量的案例对其进行评估
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.28,0:12:21.28,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但是对于大多数应用的早期开发来说
Dialogue: 0,0:12:21.28,0:12:26.56,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我看到许多人在开发它时就像我一样只用一个例子
Dialogue: 0,0:12:26.56,0:12:28.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但是，对于更成熟的应用来说
Dialogue: 0,0:12:28.52,0:12:35.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,有时，用更多的例子来评估提示可能是有用的
Dialogue: 0,0:12:35.12,0:12:40.16,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,例如，在几十张信息表上测试不同的提示，以了解
Dialogue: 0,0:12:40.16,0:12:44.12,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,在多个信息表上的平均或最坏情况下的表现如何
Dialogue: 0,0:12:44.12,0:12:48.80,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,但通常情况下，只有当一个应用程序比较成熟时，你才会这样做
Dialogue: 0,0:12:48.80,0:12:50.60,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,而且你必须有这些指标来推动
Dialogue: 0,0:12:50.60,0:12:54.56,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,你必须有这些指标来推动最后几步的增量的迅速改进
Dialogue: 0,0:12:54.56,0:12:57.52,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,因此，请大家玩一玩
Dialogue: 0,0:12:57.52,0:13:00.24,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,Jupyter Notebook的例子，尝试一下
Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.24,0:13:03.32,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,不同的变化，看看你得到了什么结果
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.32,0:13:06.36,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,当你完成后，让我们继续看下一个视频
Dialogue: 0,0:13:06.36,0:13:10.20,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,我们将讨论软件应用中的一个非常普遍的用途
Dialogue: 0,0:13:10.20,0:13:13.28,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,大语言模型在软件应用中的一个非常普遍的用途
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.28,0:13:15.48,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,这就是对文本进行总结
Dialogue: 0,0:13:15.48,0:13:25.48,蓝中字,,0,0,0,,所以，当你准备好了，让我们继续看下一个视频
