1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,840
大语言模型非常善于将其输入转换为不同的格式
 Large language models are very good at transforming its input to a different format

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,100
例如，输入一种语言的文本并将其转换或
 such as inputting a piece of text in one language and transforming it or

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,300
把它翻译成不同的语言，或者帮助进行拼写和语法的修正
 translating it to a different language or helping with spelling and grammar corrections

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,780
因此，将一段可能不符合标准的语法文本作为输入
 So taking as input a piece of text that may not be

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,020
并让它帮助你纠正拼写和语法
 fully grammatical and helping you to fix that up a bit

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,380
或甚至转换格式，如
 or even transforming formats such as inputting

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,100
输入HTML和输出JSON
 HTML and outputting JSON

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,140
所以，我以前写的一些应用程序有点痛苦，用的是
 So there's a bunch of applications that I used to write somewhat painfully with

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,100
一堆正则表达式的应用
 a bunch of regular expressions that would definitely be much more

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,800
现在用一个大语言模型和一些提示语就可以更简单地实现
 simply implemented now with a large language model and a few prompts

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,500
是的，我现在用ChatGPT来校对我写的几乎所有东西
 Yeah, I use ChatGPT to proofread pretty much everything I write these days

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,340
所以我很高兴现在向你展示Notebook中的一些更多的例子
 So I'm excited to show you some more examples in the notebook now

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,900
所以，首先，我们将导入openai，同时
 So first, we'll import openai and also

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,180
使用我们在整个视频中一直使用的get_completion辅助函数
 use the same get_completion helper function that we've been using throughout the videos

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,540
我们要做的第一件事是一个翻译任务
 The first thing we'll do is a translation task

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,940
因此，大语言模型是在许多来源的大量文本上训练出来的
 So large language models are trained on a lot of text from many sources

17
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,100
其中有很多是互联网
 a lot of which is the Internet

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,600
这当然是用许多不同的语言
 and this is of course in many different languages

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,580
因此，这使模型具有翻译能力
 So this imbues the model with the ability to do translation

20
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,380
这些模型知道数百种语言的不同程度的熟练程度
 These models know hundreds of languages to varying degrees of proficiency

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,540
所以我们将通过一些例子来说明如何使用这种能力
 So we'll go through some examples of how to use this capability

22
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,580
所以，让我们从简单的东西开始
 So let's start off with something simple

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,540
所以在这第一个例子中
 So in this first example

24
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,700
提示是将以下英文文本翻译成西班牙语
 the prompt is translate the following English text to Spanish

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,260
你好，我想订购一台搅拌机
 Hi, I would like to order a blender

26
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,620
响应是：Hola
 The response is, Hola

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,580
me gustaría ordenar una licuadora.
 me gustaría ordenar una licuadora

28
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,660
我对所有讲西班牙语的人感到非常抱歉
 I'm very sorry to all of you Spanish speakers

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,620
我从来没有学过西班牙语，很不幸，你肯定能看出来
 I never learned Spanish unfortunately, as you can definitely tell

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,220
让我们尝试另一个例子
 Let's try another example

31
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,460
所以在这个例子中
 So in this example

32
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,220
提示是，告诉我这是什么语言
 the prompt is, tell me what language this is

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,980
那么这是用法语说的
 Then this is in French

34
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,700
combien coûte le lampadaire?
 combien coûte le lampadaire?

35
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,020
所以我们来运行这个
 So let's run this

36
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,340
该模型已经识别出这是法语
 The model has identified that this is French

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,220
该模型还可以一次做多个翻译
 The model can also do multiple translations at once

38
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,900
所以在这个例子中
 So in this example

39
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,740
让我们说把下面的文字翻译成法语和西班牙语
 let's say translate the following text to French and Spanish

40
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,940
你知道吗，让我们再加一个
 You know what, let's add another

41
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,060
英国海盗
 an English pirate

42
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,500
这段文字是，我想订购一个篮球
 The text is, I want to order a basketball

43
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,180
所以这里我们有法语
 So here we have French

44
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,300
西班牙文，和英国海盗
 Spanish, and English pirate

45
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,300
所以在某些语言中
 So in some languages

46
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,340
翻译可以改变，取决于
 the translation can change depending on

47
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,660
说话人与听话人的关系
 the speaker's relationship to the listener

48
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,860
你也可以向语言模型解释这一点
 You can also explain this to the language model

49
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,380
这样它就能进行相应的翻译
 and so it will be able to translate accordingly

50
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,540
所以在这个例子中
 So in this example

51
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,220
我们说把下面的文字以正式和非正式的形式翻译成西班牙语
 we say translate the following text to Spanish in both the formal and informal forms

52
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,060
你想订购一个枕头吗？
 Would you like to order a pillow?

53
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,260
还注意到，我们在这里使用了
 Also notice here, we're using

54
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,300
不同的分隔符，而不是这些双引号
 a different delimiter than these backticks

55
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,260
其实这并不重要，只要它是一个清晰的分隔
 It doesn't really matter as long as it's a clear separation

56
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,700
所以这里我们有正式和非正式
 So here we have the formal and informal

57
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,580
因此，正式的是当你和某人说话时，他是
 So formal is when you're speaking to someone who's

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,980
也许比你高级的人，或者你是在一个专业的情况下
 maybe senior to you or you're in a professional situation

59
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,340
这时你要使用正式语气
 That's when you use a formal tone

60
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,540
然后非正式的是当你和一群朋友说话时
 and then informal is when you're speaking to maybe a group of friends

61
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,300
我实际上不会说西班牙语
 I don't actually speak Spanish

62
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,500
但我父亲会，他说这是正确的
 but my dad does and he says that this is correct

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,020
因此，对于
 So for the next example

64
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:47,900
我们要假装自己是一家跨国电子商务公司的负责人
 we're going to pretend that we're in charge of a multinational e-commerce company

65
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,780
用户的信息将使用所有不同的语言
 and so the user messages are going to be in all different languages

66
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,340
因此，用户将用各种不同的语言告诉我们关于IT的问题
 and so users are going to be telling us about the IT issues in wide variety of languages

67
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,300
所以我们需要一个通用的翻译器
 So we need a universal translator

68
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,980
因此，首先，我们将粘贴一个各种不同语言的用户信息的列表
 So first, we'll just paste in a list of user messages in a variety of different languages

69
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:15,660
现在，我们将循环浏览这些用户信息中的每一条
 Now, we will loop through each of these user messages

70
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,900
因此，对于用户信息中的问题
 So for issue in user messages

71
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,220
然后我将复制稍长的代码块
 and then I'm going to copy over the slightly longer code block

72
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,740
所以我们要做的第一件事是要求模型
 So the first thing we'll do is ask the model

73
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,420
告诉我们这个问题是什么语言的
 to tell us what language the issue is in

74
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,260
所以这里是提示
 So here's the prompt

75
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,380
然后，我们将打印出原始信息的语言和问题
 Then we'll print out the original messages language and the issue

76
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,100
然后我们将要求模型将其翻译成英语和韩语
 and then we'll ask the model to translate it into English and Korean

77
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,860
所以让我们运行这个。所以，原始信息是法语
 So let's run this. So the original message in French

78
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,300
所以我们有各种语言
 So we have a variety of languages

79
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,940
然后模型将它们翻译成英语和韩语
 and then the model translates them into English and then Korean

80
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,180
你可以看到这里，所以模型说
 You can see here, so the model says

81
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,700
这是法语
 this is French

82
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,380
所以这是因为这个提示的反应将是，这是法语
 So that's because the response from this prompt is going to be, this is French

83
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,180
你可以尝试将这个提示编辑成这样的内容
 You could try editing this prompt to say something like

84
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,540
告诉我这是什么语言
 tell me what language this is

85
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,220
只用一个词来回答或不用句子
 respond with only one word or don't use a sentence

86
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,340
如果你希望这只是一个词的话
 that kind of thing if you wanted this to just be one word

87
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,580
或者你可以要求它以JSON格式或类似的东西
 or you could ask for it in a JSON format or something like that

88
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,420
这可能会鼓励它不要使用整个句子
 which would probably encourage it to not use a whole sentence

89
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,620
因此，令人惊讶的是，你刚刚建立了一个通用翻译器
 So amazing, you've just built a universal translator

90
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,180
也可以随时暂停视频，在这里添加任何你想尝试的其他语言
 and also feel free to pause the video and add any other languages you want to try here

91
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,340
也许是你自己说的语言
 maybe languages you speak yourself

92
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,860
看看这个模型是怎么做的
 and see how the model does

93
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,060
因此，我们接下来要深入研究的是语气转换
 So the next thing we're going to dive into is tone transformation

94
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,300
写作可以根据目标受众而有所不同
 Writing can vary based on an intended audience

95
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,140
我给同事或教授写电子邮件的方式
 the way that I would write an e-mail to a colleague or a professor

96
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,820
显然会与我给我弟弟发短信的方式完全不同
 is obviously going to be quite different to the way I text my younger brother

97
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,980
所以ChatGPT实际上也可以帮助产生不同的语气
 So ChatGPT can actually also help produce different tones

98
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,260
因此，让我们看一些例子
 So let's look at some examples

99
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,620
在这第一个例子中
 So in this first example

100
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,780
提示是，将以下内容从俚语翻译成商务信函
 the prompt is, translate the following from slang to a business letter

101
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,100
老兄，这是乔
 Dude, this is Joe

102
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,180
检查一下这盏落地灯的规格
 check out the spec on the standing lamp

103
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,460
因此，让我们来执行这个
 So let's execute this

104
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,500
正如你所看到的，我们有一封更正式的商业信函
 As you can see, we have a much more formal business letter

105
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,660
有一个关于落地灯规格的建议
 with a proposal for a standing lamp specification

106
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,580
我们要做的下一件事是在不同的格式之间进行转换
 The next thing that we're going to do is to convert between different formats

107
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:50,260
ChatGPT非常善于在不同的格式之间进行转换，如JSON到HTML
 ChatGPT is very good at translating between different formats such as JSON to HTML

108
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,300
XML，各种各样的东西，markdown
 XML, all kinds of things, markdown

109
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,660
所以在提示中，我们将描述输入和输出的格式
 So in the prompt, we'll describe both the input and the output formats

110
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,900
所以这里有一个例子
 So here is an example

111
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,100
所以我们有这样一个JSON
 So we have this JSON that

112
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,340
它包含一个餐厅员工的名单，包括他们的名字和电子邮件
 contains a list of restaurant employees with their name and e-mail

113
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,580
然后在提示中
 Then in the prompt

114
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,940
我们将要求模型将其从JSON翻译成HTML
 we're going to ask the model to translate this from JSON to HTML

115
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,100
所以提示是，把下面的Python字典从JSON翻译成
 So the prompt is, translate the following Python dictionary from JSON to

116
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,260
HTML，包括列头和标题
 HTML with column headers and titles

117
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:35,380
然后我们将从模型中得到响应并打印出来
 Then we'll get the response from the model and print it

118
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:44,140
所以这里我们有一些HTML显示所有的雇员姓名和电子邮件
 So here we have some HTML displaying all of the employee names and e-mails

119
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:49,220
那么现在让我们来看看我们是否可以作为
 So now let's see if we can actually view this HTML

120
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,460
所以我们要使用这个Python库中的这个显示函数
 So we're going to use this display function from this Python library

121
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,860
显示 HTML 响应
 display HTML response

122
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:06,340
在这里你可以看到这是一个正确格式化的HTML表格
 Here you can see that this is a properly formatted HTML table

123
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:13,100
我们要做的下一个转换任务是拼写检查和语法检查
 The next transformation task we're going to do is spell check and grammar checking

124
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,740
这是ChatGPT的一个非常流行的用途
 This is a really popular use for ChatGPT

125
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,780
我强烈建议这样做
 I highly recommend doing this

126
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,060
我一直在做这个
 I do this all the time

127
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,380
当你用非母语工作时，它尤其有用
 It's especially useful when you're working in a non-native language

128
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,140
因此，这里有一些常见的语法和拼写问题的例子
 So here are some examples of some common grammar and spelling problems

129
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,580
以及语言模型如何帮助解决这些问题
 and how the language model can help address these

130
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:40,500
所以我将粘贴一个有一些语法或拼写错误的句子列表
 So I'm going to paste in a list of sentences that have some grammatical or spelling errors

131
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,420
然后，我们将循环浏览每一个句子
 Then we're going to loop through each of these sentences

132
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,140


133
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,740
然后
 And

134
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,620

135
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,620
让模型进行校对
 ask the model to proofread these. 

136
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,500
校对并进行修正。然后我们将使用一些分隔符
 Proofread and correct. And then we'll use some delimiters. 

137
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:11,500

138
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,500
然后我们将获取响应并将其打印出来，就像往常一样
 And then we will get the response and print it as usual. 

139
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:31,500


140
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,260


141
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:41,420
就这样，这个模型能够纠正所有这些语法错误
 And so the model is able to correct all of these grammatical errors

142
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,180
我们可以使用我们之前讨论过的一些技术
 We could use some of the techniques that we've discussed before

143
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:50,100
因此，为了改进提示，我们可以说校对和纠正以下文字
 So to improve the prompt, we could say proofread and correct the following text

144
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,580
并重写
 And rewrite

145
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,580
哦
 Oh

146
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:05,580
并重写整个
 And rewrite the whole

147
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,580
并重写
 And rewrite it

148
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:16,580
改正后的版本
 Corrected version

149
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:25,700
如果你没有发现任何错误，就说没有发现错误
 If you don't find any errors, just say no errors found

150
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,700
让我们来试试这个
 Let's try this

151
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:37,700
因此，这种方式我们能够，哦，他们在这里仍然使用引号
 So this way we were able to, oh, they're still using quotes here

152
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,940
但你可以想象，你能够找到一种方法，用一点点的
 But you can imagine you'd be able to find a way with a little bit of

153
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,780
迭代提示开发
 iterative prompt development to

154
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,260
找到一种更可靠的提示方式，每一次都能正常工作
 kind of find a prompt that works more reliably every single time

155
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,700
因此，现在我们将实现另一个例子
 And so now we'll do another example

156
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,040
在你把你的文本发布到公共论坛之前，检查它总是有用的
 It's always useful to check your text before you post it in a public forum

157
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,100
因此，我们将通过一个检查评论的例子
 And so we'll go through an example of checking a review

158
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,980
这里有一个关于毛绒熊猫的评论
 And so here is a review about a stuffed panda

159
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,740
因此，我们将要求模型校对和纠正评论
 And so we're going to ask the model to proofread and correct the review

160
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,100
很好。所以我们有了这个更正的版本
 Great. So we have this corrected version

161
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,860
我们可以做的一件很酷的事情是找到
 And one cool thing we can do is find

162
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,180
我们的原始评论和模型的输出之间的差异
 the kind of differences between our original review and the model's output

163
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,380
所以我们要基于这个Redlines Python包来做这个
 So we're going to use this red lines Python package to do this

164
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,800
我们将得到以下的差异
 And we're going to get the diff between

165
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,460
我们评论的原文和模型的输出之间的差异
 the original text of our review and the model output

166
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,740
然后显示这个
 and then display this

167
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,340
所以在这里你可以看到原始评论和模型输出之间的差异
 And so here you can see the diff between the original review

168
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,940
和模型输出之间的差异，以及那些已经被纠正的东西
 and the model output and the kind of things that have been corrected

169
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,380
因此，我们使用的提示是校对和纠正这个评论
 So the prompt that we use was proofread and correct this review

170
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,820
但你也可以做一些更戏剧性的改变
 But you can also make kind of more dramatic changes

171
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,700
语气的变化，以及诸如此类的事情
 kind of changes to tone and that kind of thing

172
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,340
因此，让我们再试一试
 So let's try one more thing

173
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,500
所以在这个提示中，我们将要求模特校对和纠正
 So in this prompt, we're going to ask the model to proofread and correct

174
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,700
同样的评论，但也要使其更有说服力，并确保其
 the same review, but also make it more compelling and ensure that it

175
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,860
遵循APA风格，并针对高级读者
 follows APA style and targets an advanced reader

176
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,860
我们还将要求以Markdown格式输出结果
 And we're also going to ask for the output in markdown format

177
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,780
因此，我们在这里使用原始审查的相同文本
 And so we're using the same text from the original review up here

178
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,260
因此，让我们来执行这个
 So let's execute this

179
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:30,380
在这里，我们有一个扩展的APA风格的毛绒熊猫的评论
 And here we have a expanded APA style review of the soft Panda

180
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,300
因此，这是它的转换视频
 So this is it for the transforming video

181
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,700
接下来，我们将使用扩写功能，采取较短的提示
 Next up, we have expanding where we'll take a shorter prompt

182
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:54,180
并从语言模型中产生一个更长、更自由的反应
 and kind of generate a longer, more freeform response from a language model
