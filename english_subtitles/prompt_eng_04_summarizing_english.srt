1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,680
There's so much text in today's world, pretty much none of us have enough time to read all

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,760
the things we wish we had time to

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,920
So one of the most exciting applications I've seen of large language models is to use it

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,660
to summarize text

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,480
And this is something that I'm seeing multiple teams build into multiple software applications

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,880
You can do this in the ChatGPT web interface

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,000
I do this all the time to summarize articles so I can just kind of read the content of

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
many more articles than I previously could

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,880
And if you want to do this more programmatically, you'll see how to in this lesson

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,520
So that's let's dig into the code to see how you could use this yourself to summarize text

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,280
So let's start off with the same starter code as you saw before of import openai, load the

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,620
API key and here's that get_completion helper function

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:00,640
I'm going to use as the running example, the task of summarizing this product review

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,320
and so on and so on

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,640
If you're building an e commerce website, and there's just a large volume of reviews

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,680
having a tool to summarize the lengthy reviews could give you a way to very quickly glance

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,200
over more reviews to get a better sense of what all your customers are thinking

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,280
So here's a prompt for generating a summary

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,600
Your task is generate a short summary of a product review from e commerce website, summarize

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,800
review below, and so on, in at most 30 words

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,400
And so this is soft and cute panda plush toy loved by daughter, but small for the price

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
arrived early

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Not bad

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
It's a pretty good summary

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,760
And as you saw in the previous video, you can also play with things like controlling

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,720
the character count or the number of sentences to affect the length of this summary

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,920
Now sometimes when creating a summary, if you have a very specific purpose in mind for

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,600
the summary, for example, if you want to give feedback to the shipping department, you can

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,200
also modify the prompt to reflect that so that they can generate a summary that is more

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,600
applicable to one particular group in your business

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:26,880
So for example, if I add to give feedback to the shipping department, let's say I change

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:35,800
this to start to focus on any aspects that mention shipping and delivery of the product

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,560
And if I run this, then again, you get a summary, but instead of starting off with soft and

35
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,120
cute panda plush toy, it now focuses on the fact that it arrived a day earlier than expected

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,600
And then it still has, you know, other details

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,640
Or as another example, if we aren't trying to give feedback to the shipping department

38
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:09,520
but let's say we want to give feedback to the pricing department

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,760
So the pricing department is responsible for determining the price of the product

40
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,960
And I'm going to tell it to focus on any aspects that are relevant to the price and perceived

41
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,240
value

42
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,520
Then this generates a different summary that it says

43
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,480
maybe the price may be too high for a size

44
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,640
Now in the summaries that I've generated for the shipping department or the pricing department

45
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,400
it focuses a bit more on information relevant to those specific departments

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,000
And in fact, feel free to pause the video now and maybe ask it to generate information

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,360
for the product department responsible for the customer experience of the product or

48
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,920
for something else that you think might be interesting to an e-commerce site

49
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,000
But in these summaries, even though it generated the information relevant to shipping, it had

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,240
some other information too, which you could decide may or may not be helpful

51
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:20,120
So depending on how you want to summarize it, you can also ask it to extract information

52
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,960
rather than summarize it

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,920
So here's a prompt that says you're tasked to extract relevant information to give feedback

54
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,200
to the shipping department

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,440
And now it just says, product arrived a day earlier than expected without all of the other

56
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,240
information, which was also helpful in a general summary, but less specific to the shipping

57
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,000
department if all it wants to know is what happened with the shipping

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,600
Lastly, let me just share with you a concrete example for how to use this in a workflow

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,760
to help summarize multiple reviews to make them easier to read

60
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,920
So here are a few reviews

61
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,920
This is kind of long, but here's a second review for a standing lamp

62
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
need a lamp on a bedroom

63
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,280
Here's a third review for an electric toothbrush

64
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,600
My dental hygienist recommended

65
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,640
Kind of a long review about the electric toothbrush

66
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,920
This is a review for a blender when it said, so said 17 piece system on seasonal sale and

67
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
so on and so on

68
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,280
This is actually a lot of text

69
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
If you want, feel free to pause the video and read through all this text

70
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,480
But what if you want to know what these reviewers wrote without having to stop and read all

71
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
this in detail?

72
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:41,600
So I'm going to set review_1 to be just the product review that we had up there

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,320
I'm going to put all of these reviews into a list

74
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:53,800
And now if I implement a for loop over the reviews

75
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:01,240
So here's my prompt and here I've asked it to summarize it in at most 20 words

76
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,320
Then let's have it get the response and print it out

77
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,760
And let's run that

78
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,360
And it prints out the first review is that PandaToy review, summary review of the lamp

79
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,880
summary review of the toothbrush, and then the blender

80
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:29,800
And so if you have a website where you have hundreds of reviews, you can imagine how you

81
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,360
might use this to build a dashboard, to take huge numbers of reviews, generate short summaries

82
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,760
of them so that you or someone else can browse the reviews much more quickly

83
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:46,200
And then if they wish, maybe click in to see the original longer review

84
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,640
And this can help you efficiently get a better sense of what all of your customers are thinking

85
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,640
All right, so that's it for summarizing

86
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,960
And I hope that you can picture if you have any applications with many pieces of text

87
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,680
how you can use prompts like these to summarize them to help people quickly get a sense of

88
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,240
what's in the text, the many pieces of text, and perhaps optionally dig in more

89
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,520
if they wish

90
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,640
In the next video, we'll look at another capability of large language models, which is to make

91
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,880
inferences using text

92
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,280
For example, what if you had, again, product reviews, and you wanted to very quickly get

93
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,680
a sense of which product reviews have a positive or a negative sentiment?

94
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:49,840
Let's take a look at how to do that in the next video
