00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to this course on ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm thrilled to have with me Iza Fulford to teach this along with me

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
She is a member of the technical staff of OpenAI and had built the popular

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
ChatGPT Retrieval plugin and a large part of her work has been teaching people

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
how to use LLM or large language model technology in products

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
She's also contributed to the OpenAI cookbook that teaches people prompting

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So thrilled to have you with you

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And I'm thrilled to be here and share some prompting best practices with you all

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So there's been a lot of material on the internet for prompting with articles

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
like 30 prompts everyone has to know

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A lot of that has been focused on the ChatGPT web user interface

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
which many people are using to do specific and often one-off tasks

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But I think the power of LLMs, large language models as a developer too

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that is using API calls to LLMs to quickly build software applications

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I think that is still very underappreciated

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In fact, my team at AI Fund, which is a sister company to Deep Learning.AI

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
has been working with many startups on applying these technologies

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to many different applications

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And it's been exciting to see what LLM APIs can enable developers

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
to very quickly build

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So in this course, we'll share with you some of the possibilities

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
for what you can do as well as best practices for how you can do them

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There's a lot of material to cover

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
First, you'll learn some prompting best practices for software development

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then we'll cover some common use cases, summarizing, inferring

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
transforming, expanding, and then you'll build a chatbot using an LLM

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We hope that this will spark your imagination about new applications

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
that you can build

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So in the development of large language models or LLMs

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
there have been broadly two types of LLMs, which I'm going to refer to

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
as base LLMs and instruction-tuned LLMs

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So base LLM has been trained to predict the next word based on text training data

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
often trained on a large amount of data from the internet and other sources

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
to figure out what's the next most likely word to follow

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So for example, if you were to prompt this, once upon a time there was a unicorn

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
it may complete this, that is, it may predict the next several words are

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
that live in a magical forest with all unicorn friends

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But if you were to prompt this with what is the capital of France

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
then based on what articles on the internet might have

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
it's quite possible that the base LLM will complete this with

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
what is France's largest city, what is France's population, and so on

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
because articles on the internet could quite plausibly be lists of quiz questions

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
about the country of France

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In contrast, an instruction-tuned LLM, which is where a lot of momentum

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
of LLM research and practice has been going

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
an instruction-tuned LLM has been trained to follow instructions

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So if you were to ask it, what is the capital of France

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
it's much more likely to output something like the capital of France is Paris

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So the way that instruction-tuned LLMs are typically trained is

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
you start off with a base LLM that's been trained on a huge amount of text data

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and further train it, further fine-tune it with inputs and outputs

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
that are instructions and good attempts to follow those instructions

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and then often further refine using a technique called RLHF

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
reinforcement learning from human feedback, to make the system better able

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
to be helpful and follow instructions

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Because instruction-tuned LLMs have been trained to be helpful

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
honest, and harmless, so for example, they're less likely to output

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
problematic text, such as toxic outputs, compared to base LLM

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
a lot of the practical usage scenarios have been shifting

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
toward instruction-tuned LLMs

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Some of the best practices you find on the internet may be more suited

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
for a base LLM, but for most practical applications today

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
we would recommend most people instead focus on instruction-tuned LLMs

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
which are easier to use, and also because of the work of OpenAI

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and other LLM companies, becoming safer and more aligned

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So this course will focus on best practices for instruction-tuned LLMs

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
which is what we recommend you use for most of your applications

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Before moving on, I just want to acknowledge the team from OpenAI

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and DeepLearning.ai that had contributed to the materials

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
that Isa and I will be presenting

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm very grateful to Andrew Main, Joe Palermo, Boris Power

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Ted Sanders, and Lilian Wang from OpenAI that were very involved

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
with us brainstorming materials, vetting the materials to put together

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the curriculum for this short course

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I'm also grateful on the DeepLearning side for the work

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
of Jeff Ludwig, Eddie Hsu, and Tommy Nelson

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So when you use an instruction-tuned LLM, think of giving instructions

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
to another person, say someone that's smart but doesn't know

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the specifics of your task

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So when an LLM doesn't work, sometimes it's because the instructions

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
weren't clear enough

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
For example, if you were to say, please write me something

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
about Alan Turing

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, in addition to that, it can be helpful to be clear about

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
whether you want the text to focus on his scientific work

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
or his personal life or his role in history or something else

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And if you specify what you want the tone of the text to be

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
should it take on the tone like a professional journalist would write

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
or is it more of a casual note that you dash off to a friend?

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That holds

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The LLM generates what you want

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And of course, if you picture yourself asking, say

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
a fresh college graduate to carry out this task for you

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
if you can even specify what snippets of text they should read

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
in advance to write this text about Alan Turing

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
then that even better sets up that fresh college grad for success

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
to carry out this task for you

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So in the next video, you see examples of how to be clear

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and specific, which is an important principle of prompting LLMs

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And you also learn from Isa a second principle of prompting

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that is giving a LLM time to think

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So with that, let's go on to the next video
